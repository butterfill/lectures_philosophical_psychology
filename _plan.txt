phil psych lecture 05

Use London metacog talk and Tueb talk
 - go with Tuebingen as far as the CLSTX+ conjecture and then the puzzle that motivates metacognitive feelings; prepare to stop here
 - switch to London talk.
 - [part of the idea is to contrast a minimally dual process view with modularity/core systems]
 - expand 2 systems presentation
   - motivate by referring back to earlier discussion of modularity and core systems
   - return explicitly back to Wynn’s mouse
