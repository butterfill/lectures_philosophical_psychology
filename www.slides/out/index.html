                <h3><a href="/units/intro_to_intention.html">Intention</a>
                </h3>
                <p>What are intentions and what is their role in practical reasoning and action? Some basic
distinctions from the Philosophy of Action can give us a fix on the notion of intention as
many philosophers conceive of it.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/intro_to_motor_representation.html">Motor Representation</a>
                </h3>
                <p>Motor representations are involved in performing and preparing actions.
Not all representations represent patterns of joint displacements and bodily 
configurations: some represent outcomes such as the grasping of an object, which
may be done in different ways in different contexts.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/motor_representations_ground_goals.html">Motor Representations Ground the Directedness of Actions to Goals</a>
                </h3>
                <p>How do intentions ground the purposiveness of actions? On any standard view, an intention
represents an outcome, causes an action, and does so in a way that would normally facilitate
the outcome’s occurrence. Similarly, some motor representations represent action
outcomes, play a role in generating actions, and do this in a way that normally facilitates
the occurrence of the outcomes represented.  Like intentions, motor representations
ground the directedness of actions to outcomes which are thereby goals of the actions.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/motor_representations_arent_intentions.html">Motor Representations Aren’t Intentions</a>
                </h3>
                <p>Explains why motor representations aren’t intentions.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/the_interface_problem.html">The Interface Problem</a>
                </h3>
                <p>For a single action, which outcomes it is directed to may be multiply
determined by an intention and, seemingly independently, by a motor
representation. Unless such intentions and motor representations are to pull
an agent in incompatible directions, which would typically impair action
execution, there are requirements concerning how the outcomes they represent
must be related to each other. This is the interface problem: explain how any
such requirements could be non-accidentally met.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/five_complications.html">Five Complications</a>
                </h3>
                <p>Any attempt to solve the interface problem must surmount at least five complications.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/action_experience.html">Action Experience</a>
                </h3>
                <p>What do you experience when someone acts?
According to the Action Index Conjecture,
motor representations of outcomes structure 
experiences, imaginings and (prospective) memories
in ways which provide opportunities for attention to actions directed to those outcomes.
Forming intentions concerning an outcome can influence attention to the action,
which can influence the persistence of a motor representation of the outcome.</p>

                <h3><a href="/units/goal_tracking_when.html">When can infants first track goals?</a>
                </h3>
                <p>A variety of evidence indicates that 
infants may be able to track goals from three months of age (or earlier).</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/goal_tracking_how.html">How are infants first able to track goals?</a>
                </h3>
                <p>The Teleological Stance provides a computational description of goal tracking.
It hinges on the principle that the goals of an action are those outcomes which the means are a
best available way of brining about.
Given this principle, we can infer goals from means by identifying which outcomes the means 
are a best available way of brining about.
But how is this computation performed?</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/goal_tracking_limit.html">A signature limit of infant goal tracking?</a>
                </h3>
                <p>A signature limit of a system is a pattern of behaviour the system exhibits which is both defective
given what the system is for and peculiar to that system.
There is some evidence that goal-tracking 
in infants (and adults) 
is limited by their abilities to act.
Could this be a signature limit of infant goal-tracking?</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/motor_theory_goal_tracking.html">The Motor Theory of Goal Tracking</a>
                </h3>
                <p>How do infants (and adults) track the goals of others’ actions?
According to the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking, it is sometimes* by 
means of motor processes.
More carefully, the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking consists of these claims: 
(1) in action observation, possible outcomes of observed actions are represented motorically;
(2) these representations trigger motor processes much as if the observer were performing actions
directed to the outcomes;
(3) such processes generates predictions;
(4) a triggering representation is weakened if the predictions it generates fail.
The result is that, often enough, the only only outcomes to which the observed action is a means
are represented strongly.

(*‘sometimes’ because the Motor Theory is part of a dual-process account of goal-tracking.)</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/goal_tracking_developmental_puzzle.html">A Developmental Puzzle about Goal-Tracking</a>
                </h3>
                <p>In infants,
it appears that
some,
but not all,
goal-tracking is limited by their abilities to act.
This contradicts both the Simple View and the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking.

A further puzzle arises from the fact that goal-tracking sometimes manifests in dishabitution or
pupil dilation but not proactive gaze.
How can we explain, in a principled way, why there should be discrepancies between these measures?</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/perceptual_animacy.html">Perceptual Animacy</a>
                </h3>
                <p>Perceptual animacy is
the detection by broadly perceptual processes of animate objects and their targets
citet[e.g.][]{gao:2009_psychophysics}.
Could its existence provide us with a solution to the developmental puzzle about 
goal tracking?</p>

                <p>Motor representations live a kind of double life. Although paradigmatically involved in performing
actions, they also occur when merely observing others act and sometimes influence thoughts about the
goals of observed actions. Further, these influences are content-respecting: what you think about an
action sometimes depends in part on how that action is represented motorically in you.</p>

                <p>What do we experience when we encounter others’ actions?
One hypothesis (the Indirect Hypothesis) says that such experiences are all experiences of bodily
configurations, of joint displacements and of effects characteristic of particular actions.
Another hypothesis (the Direct Hypothesis) says that 
in observing an action we sometimes experience not only bodily configurations and joint displacements
and their sensory effects but also the action as directed to a particular outcome.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>Many animals including scrub jays (Clayton, Dally and Emery 2007), ravens (Bugnyar, Reber and Buckner
2016), goats (Kaminski, Call and Tomasello 2006), dogs (Kaminski et al. 2009), ringtailed lemurs
(Sandel, MacLean and Hare 2011), monkeys (Burkart and Heschl 2007; Hattori, Kuroshima and Fujita 2009)
and chimpanzees (Melis, Call and Tomasello 2006; Karg et al. 2015) reliably vary their actions in ways
that are appropriate given facts about another’s mental states. </p>

                <p>The behaviour reading demon (a counterpart of Laplace’s demon) has unlimited cognitive capacities,
perfect knowledge of history and can conceptualise behaviours in any way imaginable. Although blind to
mental states, it can predict others’ future behaviours at least as well as any mindreader.</p>

                <p>Getting a pre-theoretical handle on joint action is best done by contrasting 
joint actions with actions that are merely individual but occur in parrallel.

The method of contrast cases is familiar from citet{Pears:1971fk}, who used 
contrast cases to argue that whether something is an ordinary, individual action 
depends on its antecedents.</p>

                <p>The Simple View, having survived the objection that it involves circularity,
now faces a yet more challenging objection.
Apparently the Simple View cannot distinguish bewteen all the contrast cases 
that an account of shared agency must distinguish.
(Contrast cases are pairs of cases where one involves shared agency
and the other does not and which are otherwise as similar as possible).</p>

                </h3>
                <p>‘I want to know what it is about propositional thought--our beliefs,
desires, intentions and speech--that makes it intelligible to others.’
(Davidson, 1995 p. 14)</p>

                </h3>
                <p>The ‘Intentional Stance’ (also ‘Intentional Strategy’) is Dennett’s name for 
a procedure for ascribing desires, beliefs and other mental states to an individual
without assuming any prior knowledge of what distinguishes her mind from others’ minds.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/social_cognition_vs_radical_interpretation.html">Social Cognition vs Radical Interpretation</a>
                </h3>
                <p>How would an account of the radical interpretation (which is about how discoveries about
minds are in principle possible) further our understanding of actual social 
cognition?</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/objection_to_intentional_stance.html">An Objection to the Intentional Stance</a>
                </h3>
                <p>Does the Intentional Stance actually describe how it would be possible,
even in principle, to infer facts about minds and actions from 
evidence that can 
be described without knowing anything about the particular actions, beliefs, desires and 
other mental states of any individual?</p>

                </h3>
                <p>There are some compelling objections to 
Davidson’s account of radical interpretation 
which motivate searching for ways to improve it.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/teleological_stance_v2.html">The Teleological Stance [recap]</a>
                </h3>
                <p>The Teleological Stance (Gergeley and Csibra , 1995) provides a computational
theory of pure goal ascription.
Pure goal ascription is the process of identifying goals to which anothers’
actions are directed independently of any knowledge, or beliefs about,
the intentions or other mental states of an agent.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/teleological_stance_limits.html">Limits of The Teleological Stance</a>
                </h3>
                <p>The Teleological Stance is subject to at leasttwo limits.
One is the Problem of Opaque Means: 
ignorance about to which ends actions are means can impair goal ascription.
Another is the Problem of False Belief:
where agents act on false beliefs, the teleological stance generates
systematically incorrect goal ascriptions.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/your_goal_is_my_goal.html">Your goal is my goal</a>
                </h3>
                <p>If an interpreter is able to interact with her targets,
if she is not limited to merely observing them,
how might this enable her to exploit a route to knowledge of the goals of their actions?
The answer hinges on interactions involving collective goals.
</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/nonreferential_communication.html">Interaction and Nonlinguistic Referential Communication</a>
                </h3>
                <p>We’ve seen that capacities for interaction make available a route
to knowlegde of others’ goals which avoids the problem of opaque means,
characterised by the ‘your-goal-is-my-goal’ inference.
This suggests a solution to a challenge about nonlinguistic referential communciation.</p>

                <p>According to Frank Jackson (1996, pp. 199–200),
it is a ‘subject-determining platitude’

                <p>It is perhaps tempting to assume that claims about phenomenology
cannot be tested scientifically.
But this is a mistake.  We can use experiments to address the question, 
Do things which have the property denoted by ‘red’ thereby appear to be different from things which lack it?</p>

other categorical colour properties.

                <p>While many findings indicate that four month old human infants
can track simple causal interactions, other evidence suggests
that two year olds have systematic difficulties tracking causal
interactions.
As many researchers have noted, this may motivate appeal to a

                </h3>
                <p>Perception involves a system (at least one) of indexes which attach to objects
These object indexes can be thought of, roughly, as mental analogues of the
pins that an old fashioned logistician sticks into a map in keeping track of
supply trucks.
When things go well, the movements of trucks on the ground are mirrored by
the movements of pins on the map.
The key characteristic of the pins is this: ignoring re-use, if you have
the same pin at two times, then the trucks it points to at those times are
one and the same truck.</p>
