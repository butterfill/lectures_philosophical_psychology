                </h3>
                <p>According to Frank Jackson (1996, pp. 199–200),
it is a ‘subject-determining platitude’
that ‘“red” denotes the property of an object putatively presented in visual experience 
when that object looks red’, and likewise for other colour terms.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/stokes_categorical_colour_argument.html">Do you visually experience red because you call things ‘red’?</a>
                </h3>
                <p>“surprising it would be indeed if I have a perceptual experience as of red
because I call the perceived object ‘red’” 
(Stokes 2006, pp. 324--5).</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/measure_categorical_colour_appearances.html">How to Measure Phenomenology</a>
                </h3>
                <p>It is perhaps tempting to assume that claims about phenomenology
cannot be tested scientifically.
But this is a mistake.  We can use experiments to address the question, 
Do things which have the property denoted by ‘red’ thereby appear to be different from things which lack it?</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/why_think_we_see_red.html">Why Do Some Claim to Visually Experience Red?</a>
                </h3>
                <p>Suppose, as argued, it is untrue that humans visually experience red or any
other categorical colour properties.
Why have so many philosophers have assumed the opposite, and done so without argument?</p>

                <h3><a href="/units/intro_to_intention.html">Intention in the Philosophy of Action</a>
                </h3>
                <p>What are intentions and what is their role in practical reasoning and action? Some basic
distinctions from the Philosophy of Action can give us a fix on the notion of intention as
many philosophers conceive of it.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/intro_to_motor_representation.html">Motor Representation</a>
                </h3>
                <p>Motor representations are involved in performing and preparing actions.
Not all representations represent patterns of joint displacements and bodily 
configurations: some represent outcomes such as the grasping of an object, which
may done in different ways in different contexts.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/motor_representations_ground_goals.html">Motor Representations Ground the Directedness of Actions to Goals</a>
                </h3>
                <p>How do intentions ground the purposiveness of actions? On any standard view, an intention
represents an outcome, causes an action, and does so in a way that would normally facilitate
the outcome’s occurrence. Similarly, some motor representations represent action
outcomes, play a role in generating actions, and do this in a way that normally facilitates
the occurrence of the outcomes represented.  Like intentions, motor representations
ground the directedness of actions to outcomes which are thereby goals of the actions.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/motor_representations_arent_intentions.html">Motor Representations Aren’t Intentions</a>
                </h3>
                <p>Explains why motor representations aren’t intentions.</p>
                <h3><a href="/units/the_interface_problem.html">The Interface Problem</a>
                </h3>
                <p>For a single action, which outcomes it is directed to may be multiply
determined by an intention and, seemingly independently, by a motor
representation. Unless such intentions and motor representations are to pull
an agent in incompatible directions, which would typically impair action
execution, there are requirements concerning how the outcomes they represent
must be related to each other. This is the interface problem: explain how any
such requirements could be non-accidentally met.</p>

                <p>What do we experience when we encounter others’ actions?
One hypothesis (the Indirect Hypothesis) says that such experiences are all experiences of bodily
configurations, of joint displacements and of effects characteristic of particular actions.
Another hypothesis (the Direct Hypothesis) says that 
in observing an action we sometimes experience not only bodily configurations and joint displacements
and their sensory effects but also the action as directed to a particular outcome.</p>

                <p>Motor representations live a kind of double life. Although paradigmatically involved in performing
actions, they also occur when merely observing others act and sometimes influence thoughts about the
goals of observed actions. Further, these influences are content-respecting: what you think about an
action sometimes depends in part on how that action is represented motorically in you.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>The Teleological Stance (Gergeley and Csibra , 1995) provides a computational
theory of pure goal ascription.
Pure goal ascription is the process of identifying goals to which anothers’
actions are directed independently of any knowledge, or beliefs about,
the intentions or other mental states of an agent.</p>

                <p>Marr helpfully distinguishes computational description (What is the thing for and how does it achieve this?)
from representations and algorithms (How are the inputs and outputs represented, and how is the transformation accomplished?)
and from the hardware implementation (How are the  representations and algorithms physically realised?)</p>

                </h3>
                <p>Motor representations occur when merely observing others act and sometimes influence thoughts about the
goals of observed actions. Further, these influences are content-respecting: what you think about an
action sometimes depends in part on how that action is represented motorically in you. The existence of
such content-respecting influences is puzzling. After all, motor representations do not feature
alongside beliefs or intentions in reasoning about action; indeed, thoughts are inferentially isolated
from motor representations. So how could motor representations have content-respecting influences on
thoughts?</p>

                </h3>
                <p>While many findings indicate that four month old human infants
can track simple causal interactions, other evidence suggests
that two year olds have systematic difficulties tracking causal
interactions.
As many researchers have noted, this may motivate appeal to a 
dual process account (or one involving ‘core knowledge’ or ‘modularity’).</p>

                <h3><a href="/units/object_indexes.html">Object Indexes</a>
                </h3>
                <p>Perception involves a system (at least one) of indexes which attach to objects
These object indexes can be thought of, roughly, as mental analogues of the
pins that an old fashioned logistician sticks into a map in keeping track of
supply trucks.
When things go well, the movements of trucks on the ground are mirrored by
the movements of pins on the map.
The key characteristic of the pins is this: ignoring re-use, if you have
the same pin at two times, then the trucks it points to at those times are
one and the same truck.</p>

Wilson and Robinson’s (1986) version of 
the Pulfrich double pendulum illusion is correct.</p>

                <p>Getting a pre-theoretical handle on joint action is best done by contrasting 
joint actions with actions that are merely individual but occur in parrallel.

The method of contrast cases is familiar from citet{Pears:1971fk}, who used 
contrast cases to argue that whether something is an ordinary, individual action 
depends on its antecedents.</p>

now faces a yet more challenging objection.
Apparently the Simple View cannot distinguish bewteen all the contrast cases 
that an account of shared agency must distinguish.
(Contrast cases are pairs of cases where one involves shared agency
and the other does not and which are otherwise as similar as possible).</p>

                <p>A signature limit of a model is a prediction which can be derived from the model,
which cannot be derived from any other models under consideration, and which is untrue.
Signature limits make it possible to test hypotheses about which model characterises
a particular mindreading process.</p>
