Some basic
distinctions from the Philosophy of Action can give us a fix on the notion of intention as
many philosophers conceive of it.</p><h3><a href="/units/intro_to_motor_representation.html">Motor Representation</a></h3><p>Motor representations are involved in performing and preparing actions.
Not all representations represent patterns of joint displacements and bodily 
configurations: some represent outcomes such as the grasping of an object, which
may be done in different ways in different contexts.</p><h3><a href="/units/motor_representations_ground_goals.html">Motor Representations Ground the Directedness of Actions to Goals</a></h3><p>How do intentions ground the purposiveness of actions? On any standard view, an intention
represents an outcome, causes an action, and does so in a way that would normally facilitate
the outcome’s occurrence. Similarly, some motor representations represent action
outcomes, play a role in generating actions, and do this in a way that normally facilitates
the occurrence of the outcomes represented.  Like intentions, motor representations
ground the directedness of actions to outcomes which are thereby goals of the actions.</p><h3><a href="/units/motor_representations_arent_intentions.html">Motor Representations Aren’t Intentions</a></h3><p>Explains why motor representations aren’t intentions.</p><h3><a href="/units/the_interface_problem.html">The Interface Problem</a></h3><p>For a single action, which outcomes it is directed to may be multiply
determined by an intention and, seemingly independently, by a motor
representation. Unless such intentions and motor representations are to pull
an agent in incompatible directions, which would typically impair action
execution, there are requirements concerning how the outcomes they represent
must be related to each other. This is the interface problem: explain how any
such requirements could be non-accidentally met.</p><h3><a href="/units/five_complications.html">Five Complications</a></h3><p>Any attempt to solve the interface problem must surmount at least five complications.</p><h3><a href="/units/action_experience.html">Action Experience</a></h3><p>What do you experience when someone acts?
According to the Action Index Conjecture,
motor representations of outcomes structure 
experiences, imaginings and (prospective) memories
in ways which provide opportunities for attention to actions directed to those outcomes.
Forming intentions concerning an outcome can influence attention to the action,
which can influence the persistence of a motor representation of the outcome.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="lecture_02"><div class="page-header"><h2><a href="/lecture_02.html" target="_blank">Lecture 02: Pure Goal Tracking - A Developmental Puzzle</a></h2><p>Date given: Thursday 12th October 2017</p><p> <a href="/lecture_02.html" target="_blank">slides</a> , <a href="/handouts/lecture_02.handout.pdf" target="_blank">handout [pdf]</a></p><div style="border-left: 1px dotted grey;margin-left: -1px;" class="units"><div style="padding-left:2em;"><h3><a href="/units/goal_tracking_when.html">When can infants first track goals?</a></h3><p>A variety of evidence indicates that 
infants may be able to track goals from three months of age (or earlier).</p><h3><a href="/units/goal_tracking_how.html">How are infants first able to track goals?</a></h3><p>The Teleological Stance provides a computational description of goal tracking.
It hinges on the principle that the goals of an action are those outcomes which the means are a
best available way of brining about.
Given this principle, we can infer goals from means by identifying which outcomes the means 
are a best available way of brining about.
But how is this computation performed?</p><h3><a href="/units/goal_tracking_limit.html">A signature limit of infant goal tracking?</a></h3><p>A signature limit of a system is a pattern of behaviour the system exhibits which is both defective
given what the system is for and peculiar to that system.
There is some evidence that goal-tracking 
in infants (and adults) 
is limited by their abilities to act.
Could this be a signature limit of infant goal-tracking?</p><h3><a href="/units/motor_theory_goal_tracking.html">The Motor Theory of Goal Tracking</a></h3><p>How do infants (and adults) track the goals of others’ actions?
According to the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking, it is sometimes* by 
means of motor processes.
More carefully, the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking consists of these claims: 
(1) in action observation, possible outcomes of observed actions are represented motorically;
(2) these representations trigger motor processes much as if the observer were performing actions
directed to the outcomes;
(3) such processes generates predictions;
(4) a triggering representation is weakened if the predictions it generates fail.
The result is that, often enough, the only only outcomes to which the observed action is a means
are represented strongly.

(*‘sometimes’ because the Motor Theory is part of a dual-process account of goal-tracking.)</p><h3><a href="/units/goal_tracking_developmental_puzzle.html">A Developmental Puzzle about Goal-Tracking</a></h3><p>In infants,
it appears that
some,
but not all,
goal-tracking is limited by their abilities to act.
This contradicts both the Simple View and the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking.

A further puzzle arises from the fact that goal-tracking sometimes manifests in dishabitution or
pupil dilation but not proactive gaze.
How can we explain, in a principled way, why there should be discrepancies between these measures?</p><h3><a href="/units/perceptual_animacy.html">Perceptual Animacy</a></h3><p>Perceptual animacy is
the detection by broadly perceptual processes of animate objects and their targets
citet[e.g.][]{gao:2009_psychophysics}.
Could its existence provide us with a solution to the developmental puzzle about 
goal tracking?</p></div></div></div></div><div id="lecture_03"><div class="page-header"><h2><a href="/lecture_03.html" target="_blank">Lecture 03: Experience of Action</a></h2><p>Date given: Thursday 19th October 2017</p><p> <a href="/lecture_03.html" target="_blank">slides</a> , <a href="/handouts/lecture_03.handout.pdf" target="_blank">handout [pdf]</a></p><div style="border-left: 1px dotted grey;margin-left: -1px;" class="units"><div style="padding-left:2em;"><h3><a href="/units/the_interface_problem_recap.html">The Interface Problem (Recap)</a></h3><p>Some actions involve both intention and motor representation.

Although paradigmatically involved in performing
actions, they also occur when merely observing others act and sometimes influence thoughts about the
goals of observed actions. Further, these influences are content-respecting: what you think about an
action sometimes depends in part on how that action is represented motorically in you.</p><h3><a href="/units/twin_puzzles.html">The Twin Interface Problems</a></h3><p>How could intentions have content-respecting influences on motor representations given their inferential isolation?

One hypothesis (the Indirect Hypothesis) says that such experiences are all experiences of bodily
configurations, of joint displacements and of effects characteristic of particular actions.
Another hypothesis (the Direct Hypothesis) says that 
in observing an action we sometimes experience not only bodily configurations and joint displacements
and their sensory effects but also the action as directed to a particular outcome.</p><h3><a href="/units/action_experience.html">Action Experience</a></h3><p>What do you experience when someone acts?
