An immediate problem arises from the fact that pairs of things  just one of which is \emph{red} (i.e. has the property denoted by ‘red’) differ not only in this way but also in which particular shade of colour they have.
How can we tell whether differences in visual appearance are due in part to differences in being \emph{red} rather than entirely due to differences in shade?</div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><img src="/img/categorical_colour_difference1.jpg" class="bkg"/><div class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="notes">The problem can be overcome by introducing a third thing.  Consider constructing a sequence of three things which are indiscriminable except by colour.  Let the middle thing be \emph{red}, and let the first thing not be \emph{red}.  Now consider the difference between the particular hues of these two things.  Ensure the difference is small, but large enough that any two things which differ in hue by this amount are readily discriminable.  
Finally, let the third thing be \emph{red}, and let the difference with respect to hue between the third and second thing be the same as the difference between the first and second thing.  (Research on colour perception shows that such differences can be equated, and that sequences of this type exist; see 
\citealp{kuehni:2001_color} on perceptual uniformity and \citealp{witzel:2013_categorical} on categories.)  
Consider the visual appearances of these three things.</div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><img src="/img/categorical_colour_difference2.jpg" class="bkg"/><div class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><img src="/img/categorical_colour_difference3.jpg" class="bkg"/><div class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="notes">If, as the subject-determining platitude implies, humans visually experience properties like \emph{red}, then (given the premise) the first and second thing should differ in visual appearance more than the second and third thing.</div><div class="slide"><p style="margin-top:350px;">Methods</p><div class="notes">How can we test whether such differences in visual appearance  exist?  
Several methods have recently been used \citep{witzel2014category,webster:2012_color,davidoff:2012_perceptual}. %(*cite thesis?).</div></div><div class="slide"><p class="indent hem-around">1. Which outer thing is most similar to the middle one?</p><div class="notes">In one people are asked to judge, for each sequence, which of the two outer things (i.e. the first and third thing) is more similar to the middle thing (i.e. the second thing).  
Given that visual appearances typically influence judgements of similarity,
if things which differ in whether they are \emph{red} thereby differ in visual appearance, we would expect people to judge that the outer thing which is 
\emph{red} is more similar to the middle thing than the other outer thing.</div><div class="notes">\citep{kay_what_1984}: they did find an effect.
‘the English speaker judges chip B to be more similar to A than to C because the blue-green boundary passes between B and C, even though B is perceptually closer to C than to A.’ (p. 77)</div><div class="notes">According to more recent research discussed in \citep{witzel2014category}
(a published report is not yet available)
In fact they do not.
That is, whether things are \emph{red} appears to make no difference to judgements of similarity (\citealp{witzel2014category}; actually these researchers did not test ‘red’, but they did test the German terms ‘Rosa’, ‘Braun’, ‘Orange’, ‘Gelb’, ‘Gruen’, ‘Blau’, and ‘Lila’.)
This indicates that things which are \emph{red} do not thereby differ in visual appearance from things that are not \emph{red}.</div><div class="notes">From correspondence:
‘that experiment was originally reported in the same paper as the "Categorical facilitation" one, but it was too long. Up to now it is only in my thesis and there is the abstract, which I paste you below. Note, however, that we found slight traces of perceptual magnet effects around prototypes when reanalysing the data later on, which is reflected in the book chapter, but not the older abstract. The found effects are quite systematic (happening at almost all prototypes), but also extremely weak, and there were literally no effects at boundaries.’</div><div class="notes">How can we defend the view that red things differ in visual appearance from non-red things?
Maybe there are differences in visual appearance that we are not aware of?
Maybe the judgements of similarlity are not sensitive enough?
(But note that \citet{witzel2014category} did find evidence for the effect of prototypes on
judgements of similarity, so the method seems good: to test this, the three colour samples
were arranged so that the prototype was positioned between a middle and an outer sample.
‘Colours close to the prototypes were judged to be more similar than they actually were in terms of pure discrimination’.)</div></div><div class="slide"><p class="indent hem-around">2. Adjust the middle object so that it appears midway between the two outer objects.</p><div class="notes">Another method involves asking people to adjust the colour of the middle object so that it appears to be mid-way between the two outer objects.
What people  are in fact adjusting here is the hue of the object, but no mention is made of hue: their instructions are to match differences in appearance.
If things which differ in whether they are \emph{red} thereby differ in visual appearance, we would expect people to compensate for this in adjusting hue.
In fact they do not \citep{witzel2014category}.

%*NB: second approach (and third approach = perceptual grouping) matters because you might say that the things do appear differently, just in a way that we are unaware of.  Unawareness of the difference less plausibly affects grouping and hue matching; after all, if it doesn't affect these what does the difference in appearance affect?</div><div class="notes">How can we defend the view that red things differ in visual appearance from non-red things?
You could insist that the difference in appearance is not manifest in this particular case.
Perhaps, for example, because the slider people used to ajust the middle sample changed 
its hue, subjects attended to hue and ignored other features of the colour.
(There’s no evidence for this speculation and subjects were not asked about the hue.)</div><div class="notes">Are there other objections?</div><div class="notes">Could you object that the difference in appearance between red and non-red things
is already built into the metric used for the colour space?  In that case you would not
expect additional effects of categorical colour property on appearance. These effects would be
already taken into account in the measurements of similarity.</div><div class="notes">To answer this objection we need to note that there are multiple ways of 
measuring perceptual similarity.
In this case, the researchers used JNDs.
They have previously shown that category boundaries (as specified by an individual 
subject’s colour words) do not affect JNDs.  That is, JNDs are not generally smaller at the
category boundaries \citep{witzel:2013_categorical}.
But when you take pairs of colours that are, say, 3 JNDs apart, then whether or not 
the pair straddles a category boundary will affect speed and accuracy of discimination
\citep{witzel:2014_categorical}.
So we can be confident that using JNDs to measure perceptual similarity does not
take into account differences in the ways categorical colour propreties appear.</div></div><div class="slide"><p class="indent hem-around">3.
