among philosophers and theoretically-minded scientists.
It’s not just that there are different theories of shared agency; there is 
fundamental disagreement about what sort of conceptual and ontological resources

As you’ll see, there are even two completely unconnected articles on this topic

works until you know how to build it.
It is a reasonable guess that in building agents capable of exercising shared agency,
a good first target is to get them started with modest sociality.</div><div class="notes">Note that this is only a starting point: we are also going to consider large scale

series of lectures).  Of course there will be lots of further questions, but I like to
have something simple to frame our thinking and this question serves that purpose.</div><div class="notes">My hope is that by answering this seemingly straightforward question, we will be 
in a position to answer the hard question about which forms of shared agency
underpin our social nature.</div><div class="notes">The first two contrast cases are supposed to show that this question isn’t easy

Of course, there are all kinds of reasons why this might be problematic, and we 
will consider many such reasons.
But as I just said, having simple ideas to frame our thinking is good, and that’s why
I take this as my working aim.

Compare individual action: much individual action is arguably purposive but not

actions.</div><div class="notes">A further problem concerns the link between intentional joint action and intention.
Consider individual action.  Bratman has good arguments for holding that actions can
be intentional under a description even when no intention specifies that description;
and he also holds that agents incapable of intending may nevertheless perform intentional
actions.
So it is conceivable that not all intentional joint action will involve intention.
In that case, the Simple View may not even be a fully general account of intentional
joint action.</div><div class="notes">I’m not going to pursue these issues yet, but we will come back to them.

Start with individual committment (which Gilbert calls ‘personal commitment’).
You can make an individual committment to me that you will write an essay,
and I can make an individual committment to you that I will mark it.
In this case the committment entails certain obligations and perhaps rights.
Gilbert’s idea is that several people can also become collectively committed,
in which case they have a joint committment which entails collective obligations.
So the idea is that a joint commitment
is something irreducibly collective.
This is an interesting idea which will become clearer later.

Ayesha and Beatrice’s lifting the block together is not a joint action.
But in this area there is a real danger that we are just trading intutions.
So let’s see if we can find a basis for deciding whether this is a joint action.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".timerQuestion" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="slide"><div data-what="#timer2 .timer.hide" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:0}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div data-what="#timer2 .timer" data-cls="running" class="dv dv-addclass"></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><div class="notes">Here are two sentences:</div><div class="notes show"><p>The tiny drops fell from the bottle. </p></div><p class="step2 indent hide"> - distributive</p><div class="notes show"><p class="em-above">The tiny drops soaked Zach's trousers. </p></div><p class="step3 indent hide"> - collective</p><div class="slide"><div data-what=".step2" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">The first sentence is naturally read *distributively*; that is, as specifying something

Consider the sentence ‘The ants carried stones’.  This is naturally interpreted as 
implying only that each ant carried a stone, which is a distributive interpretation.
By contrast, consider this ...</div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><img src="/img/ants2.jpg" class="bkg"/><div class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="notes">Some ants harvest plant hair and fungus in order to build traps to capture large insects; 
once captured, many worker ants sting the large insects, transport them and carve them up
\citep{Dejean:2005vb}. 
There’s a lot you might extract from this behaviour (and we will return to the ants later), 
but for now just focus on the killing.
Each ant stings the large insect they have captured, where none of the stings are 
individually fatal although together they are deadly.
So when I tell you that the ants killed the large insect, this should be interpreted
collectively.  That is, it is not a matter of each ant killing the large insect;
rather killing is collectively predicated of the ants.</div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"> <div class="notes">You have two minutes to think of two sentences which, like mine,

To see this, ask yourself how many times Zach's trousers were soaked.
On the distributive reading they were soaked at least as many times as there are actions.
On the collective reading they were not necessarily soaked more than once.
(On the distributive reading there are several outcomes of the same type and each 
action has a different token outcome of this type; on the collective reading there is a single token 
outcome which is the outcome of two or more actions.)</div></div><div class="slide"><div class="notes show"><p class="em-above">Claim:</p><ol><li>When distributive, they merely act in parallel.</li><li>When collective, they act together.</li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="notes">Compare these three sentences ...</div><div class="notes show"><p>The tiny drops soaked Zach’s trousers together.</p><p>The three legs of the tripod support the camera together.</p><p>Ayesha and Beatrice lifted the block together.</p></div><div class="notes">I want to suggest that reflection on these allows us to distinguish

it doesn’t follow that there is any joint action (or even any action).

The threat was that all events in which we act together are joint actions and so the

Support from this view comes from Gilbert, who does think that 
all events in which we act together are joint actions.
However reflection on the distinction between distributive and collective 
interpretations of sentences, inclduing sentences that are not about action at all,
suggested that acting together can occur without there being a joint action.</div><div class="notes">As things stand, then, we do not yet have a reason to reject the Simple Account.</div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="" class="slide"><img src="/img/bkg/joint_action01/DSC_AB_7018.JPG" class="bkg"/><div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div><div style="" class="title-block"><div class="title-container"><h2 class="title1">Admin</h2></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><p class="blur-after">lectures </p><div class="notes">lectures are at this time every week</div><div class="slide"><p class="blur-after">web </p><div class="notes">there is a web page where you can find slides and handouts from lectures.</div></div><div class="slide"> <p class="blur-after">assessment = essays</p><div class="notes">The authoritative source for the deadlines is your undergraduate handbook.
