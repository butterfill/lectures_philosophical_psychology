          <p class="center">What are intentions for?</p>
          <div class="notes">So what are intentions for?
          </div>
          <div class="notes">I’m going to assume that intention is something over and above basic beliefs and desires; that an
intention is not, for instance, merely a strongest desire.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">There is a temptation to assume that intention is involved in every case of purposive action.
But it’s hard to see what the argument for this could be.
In many cases it seems that beliefs, desires and motor representations are all that is needed to explain purposive action. 
You offer me a biscuit.  I want one, and I believe I can get one by reaching out for it.  So I do reach for it.  As far as I can see, there’s no need to suppose that, in addition to the belief and desire, it must be the case that I also intend to take a biscuit.  
(At least not unless we take ‘intention’ to mean ‘strongest desire’, which it does not.)  
Maybe I do intend this.  
But it’s possible for an agent to take and eat a biscuit, and to do so purposively, without having any intentions at all.  
Beliefs desires and motor representations are sufficient.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">So (again), what are intentions for?
The answer has something to do with planning.  
But here we must be careful because not all planning involves intending.

Not all representations represent patterns of joint displacements and bodily

          <div class="notes">Let me mention some almost uncontroversial facts about motor representations and 
their action-coordinating role.

          <div class="slide">
            <div data-what="img.bkg" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div>
            <div class="notes">Suppose you are a cook who needs to take an egg from its box, crack it and put it (except for the
shell) into a bowl ready for beating into a carbonara sauce.
Even for such mundane, routine actions, the constraints on adequate performance can vary
significantly depending on subtle variations in context. For example, the position of a hot pan
may require altering the trajectory along which the egg is transported, or time pressures may mean
that the action must be performed unusually swiftly on this occasion.
Further, many of the constraints on performance involve relations between actions occurring at
different times.
To illustrate, how tightly you need to grip the egg now depends, among other things, on the forces
to which you will subject the egg in lifting it later.
It turns out that people reliably grip objects such as eggs just tightly enough across a range of
conditions in which the optimal tightness of grip varies.
This indicates (along with much other evidence) that information about the cook’s anticipated
future hand and arm movements appropriately influences how tightly she initially grips the egg
(compare \citealp{kawato:1999_internal}).
This anticipatory control of grasp, 
like several other features of action performance (\citealp[see][chapter 1]{rosenbaum:2010_human} for more examples),
is not plausibly a consequence of mindless physiology, nor of intention and practical reasoning.
This is one reason for postulating motor representations, which characteristically play a role in
coordinating sequences of very small scale actions such as grasping an egg in order to lift it.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">The scale of an actual action can be defined in terms of means-end relations.  
Given two actions which are related as means to ends by the processes and representations 
involved in their performance, the first is smaller in scale than the second just if the 
first is a means to the second.  Generalising, we associate the scale of an actual action 
with the depth of the hierarchy of outcomes that are related to it by the transitive closure 
of the means-ends relation.  Then, generalising further, a repeatable action (something that 
different agents might do independently on several occasions) is associated with a scale 
characteristic of the things people do when they perform that action.  Given that actions 
such as cooking a meal or painting a house count as small-scale actions, actions such as 
grasping an egg or dipping a brush into a can of paint are very-small scale.  Note that we 
do not stipulate a tight link between the very small scale and the motoric.  In some cases 
intentions may play a role in coordinating sequences of very small scale purposive actions, 
and in some cases motor representations may concern actions which are not very small scale.  
The claim we wish to consider is only that, often enough, explaining the coordination of 
sequences of very small scale actions appears to involve representations but not, or not 
only, intentions.  To a first approximation, \emph{motor representation} is a label for 
such representations.%
\footnote{% 
Much more to be said about what motor representations are; for instance, see \citet{butterfill:2012_intention} for the view that motor representations can be distinguished by representational format.

            <div class="notes">What do motor representations represent? An initially attractive, conservative 
view would be that they represent bodily configurations and joint displacements, 
or perhaps sequences of these, only.
However there is now a significant body of evidence that some motor representations 
do not specify particular sequences of bodily configurations and joint displacements, 
but rather represent outcomes such as the grasping of an egg or the pressing of a switch.  
These are outcomes which might, on different occasions, involve very different bodily 
configurations and joint displacements
(see \citealp{rizzolatti_functional_2010} for a selective review).
            </div>
            <div class="notes">Such outcomes are abstract relative to bodily configurations and joint displacements 
in that there are many different ways of achieving them.

              <div class="notes">The experiments providing such evidence typically involve a marker of motor representation, 
such as a pattern of neuronal firings, a motor evoked potential or a behavioural performance 
profile, which, in controlled settings, allows sameness or difference of motor representation 
to be distinguished.  Such markers can be exploited to show that the sameness and difference 
of motor representation is linked to the sameness and difference of an outcome such as the 
grasping of a particular object.
(Pioneering uses of this method include \citealp{rizzolatti:1988_functional,Rizzolatti:2001ug}; 
it has since been developed in many ways: see, for example,

rochat:2010_responses, bonini:2010_ventral, koch:2010_resonance}.)

<div class="notes">How do intentions ground the purposiveness of actions? On any standard view, an intention
represents an outcome, causes an action, and does so in a way that would normally facilitate
the outcome’s occurrence. Similarly, some motor representations represent action
outcomes, play a role in generating actions, and do this in a way that normally facilitates
the occurrence of the outcomes represented.  Like intentions, motor representations
ground the directedness of actions to outcomes which are thereby goals of the actions.</div>

          <div class="notes">Now as Elisabeth Pacherie has argued (and I’ve had a go at arguing this in joint work with Corrado Sinigaglia recently too),
motor representations are relevantly similar to intentions.

Of course motor representations differ from intentions in some important ways (as Pacherie also notes).

But they are similar in the respects that matter for explaining the purposiveness of action.
(1) Like intentions, some motor representations represent outcomes (and not merely patters of joint displacement, say).
(2) Like intentions, some motor representations play a role in coordinating multiple more component activities by virtue of their role as elements in hierarchically structured plans.
(3) And, like intentions, some motor representations coordinate these activities in a way that would normally facilitate the outcome’s occurrence.

The claim is not that \emph{all} purposive actions are linked to outcomes by motor representations, just that some are.
In some cases, the purposiveness of an action is grounded in a motor representation of an outcome; in other cases it is grounded in an intention.

And of course in many cases it may be that both intention and motor representation are involved.

Imagine you are in an unfamiliar city and are trying to get to the central station. 
A stranger offers you two routes. Each route could be represented by a distinct line

constrains its possible contents. For example, a representation with a cartographic 
format cannot represent what is represented by sentences such as `There could not be a 
mountain whose summit is inaccessible.'\footnote{ Note that the distinction between 
content and format is orthogonal to issues about representational medium. The maps in 
our illustration may be paper map or electronic maps, and the instructions may be spoken, 
signed or written. This difference is one of medium.} The distinction between content and 
format is necessary because, as our illustration shows, each can be varied independently 
of the other.

Suppose you are given some verbal instructions describing a route. You are then shown a representation of a route on a map and asked whether this is the same route that was verbally described. You are not allowed to find out by following the routes or by imagining following them. 
Special cases aside, answering the question will involve a process of translation because two distinct representational formats are involved, propositional and cartographic. It is not be enough that you could follow either representation of the route. You will also need to be able to translate from at least one representational format into at least one other format.

          <div class="notes">To illustrate, suppose that you have a route representation and I want to work out whether it this representation has a cartographic or propositional format.  One way to do this might be to test your performance on different tasks.  If the representation is propositional you are likely to be relatively fast at identifying key landmarks but relatively slow at translating the route into a sequence of compass directions; but the converse will be true if your representation is cartographic.

For this comparison we need to distinguish two ways of imagining seeing. There is a way of 
imagining seeing which phenomenologically is something like seeing except that it does not 
necessarily involve being receptive to stimuli. This way of imagining seeing, sometimes 
called `sensory imagining', is commonly distinguished from cognitive ways of imagining 
seeing which might for example involve thinking about seeing.
It is this way of imagining seeing an object move that we wish to compare with actually 
seeing an object move.

          <div class="handout">Judging the laterality of a hand vs of a letter. 
For ordinary subjects, the tasks differ: they are less accurate 
when the hand's position is biomechanically awkward. 
But \citet{Fiori:2012fk} show that the tasks do not so differ for subjects suffering Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which impairs motor representation \citep{parsons:1998_cerebrally}.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">It may be objected that performance differences such as these can be explained without appealing to
a difference in format. After all, rotating a ball involves an action whereas a ball rotating does
not; consequently, imagining the former may be thought to differ from imagining the latter with
respect to the contents of the representations involved. Supposing that there are differences in
content here and in other cases, could these fully explain differences in performance profile? To
see why not, consider two tasks involving mental rotation. Judging the laterality of a rotated
letter is thought to involve phenomenologically vision-like imagination
\citep{jordan:2001_cortical}, whereas judging the laterality of a rotated hand is thought to involve
phenomenologically action-like imagination \citep{parsons:1987_imagined, gentilucci:1998_right}.
Ordinary subjects who are asked to judge the laterality of a hand rotated to various degrees are
less accurate when the hand's position is biomechanically awkward. By contrast, no such effect
occurs for comparable tasks involving letters rather than hands. How could this difference in
performance in imagining hands and letters be explained? Consider the claim that the difference in
performance can be fully explained by a difference in the content of the representations involved.
Initially this might seem plausible because one task involves hands whereas the other involves
letters. However, there are subjects who can perform both tasks but whose performance is not
different for hands and letters \citep{Fiori:2012fk}. These are subjects suffering Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which impairs motor representation \citep{parsons:1998_cerebrally}. Since
ALS and ordinary subjects encounter the same stimuli and perform the same tasks, there seems to be
no reason (other than our hypothesis about a difference in format) to suppose that the two groups'
performance involves representations with different contents. So if the hand-letter difference in
performance were entirely explained by a difference in content, we would expect ALS and ordinary
subjects to exhibit the same difference in performance. But this is not the case. This is an
obstacle to supposing that the hand-letter difference in performance in ordinary subjects could be
explained by appeal to content.

          <div class="notes">So far we have been arguing that motor and visual representations differ in format. Why suppose that
motor representations also differ in format from intentions? Contrast two ways of imagining taking a
shot in basketball, one involving the phenomenologically action-like kind of imagination and the
other involving a cognitive kind of imagination. The contrast we require is roughly between the way
a former player might imagine this and the way that someone who has only ever read about basketball
might imagine it. As we have seen, the way phenomenologically action-like imagination unfolds in
time and the amount of effort it involves will depend on bio-mechanical, dynamical and postural
constraints, among others. These constraints are closely related to those which govern actually
performing such actions \citep{Jeannerod:2001yb}, and some can be altered by acquiring or losing
motor expertise. By contrast no such constraints would be expected always to apply where a cognitive
kind of imagination is involved. In line with the general strategy of inferring differences in
format from differences in characteristic performance profile, we conclude that motor
representations differ in format from those involved in cognitive kinds of imagination, which are
plausibly propositional.

<div class="notes">For a single action, which outcomes it is directed to may be multiply
determined by an intention and, seemingly independently, by a motor
representation. Unless such intentions and motor representations are to pull
an agent in incompatible directions, which would typically impair action
execution, there are requirements concerning how the outcomes they represent
must be related to each other. This is the interface problem: explain how any
such requirements could be non-accidentally met.</div>

freezing water. To your right you can see a lever and to your left there is a button. In deciding
that pulling the lever offers you a better chance of survival than pushing the button, you form an
intention to pull the lever, hoping that this will stop the wheel. If things go well, and if
intentions are not mere epiphenomena, this intention will result in your reaching for, grasping and
pulling the lever. These actions---reaching, grasping and pulling---may be directed to specific
outcomes in virtue of motor representations which guide their execution. It shouldn't be an accident
that, in your situation, you both intend to pull a lever and you end up with motor representations
of reaching for, grasping and pulling that very lever, so that the outcomes specified by your
intention match those specified by motor representations. If this match between outcomes variously
specified by intentions and by motor representations is not to be accidental, what could explain it?

about a certain pattern of action and are implicated in the production and control of
action. For instance, in the influential Motor Schema Theory proposed by Richard Schmidt
(1975, 2003), a motor schema involves a generalized motor program, together with corre-
sponding ‘recall’ and ‘recognition’ schemas. The generalized motor program is thought to
contain an abstract representation defining the general form or pattern of an action,
that is the organization and structure common to a set of motor acts (e.g., invariant
features pertaining to the order of events, their spatial configuration, their relative
timing and the relative force with which they are produced). This generalized motor
program has parameters that control it. In order to determine how an action should be
performed on a given occasion, parameter values adapted to the situation must be
specified. Thus, a motor schema also includes a rule or system of rules describing the
relationships between initial conditions, parameter values and outcomes and allowing us
to perform the action over a large range of conditions (the ‘recall schema’ in Schmidt’s
terminology). Finally, the motor schema also includes a rule or system of rules
describing the relationships between initial conditions, exteroceptive and propri-
oceptive sensory feedback during an action, and action outcome (a recognition sche- ma),
allowing agents to know when they have made an error – i.e., the action does not have
the sensory consequences it is expected to have – and to correct for it.’
            </div>
            <div class="notes">Are motor schemas an alterantive to motor representations? Tempting to think that where
they talk about motor schema, we think of motor representations that represent outcomes
that are relatively distal from action (e.g. are affector-neutral).

the nature of the motoric, we don’t distinguish motor representations that
specify actions in more detail (particular effector, particular grip) from
motor representations that specify actions in less detail.
Because they think that motor representations (or motor programmes) must be tied to
particular actions, they need motor schema.
(Partly this debate may hinge on the importance of bodily synergies and
nonrepresentational processes in the control of action: how much has to be represented
at all? More than intentions. But not necessarily each joint displacement. So we don’t
currently know where representation ends.)

Maybe the same can be true for intentions and motor representations.
Maybe intentions can involve demonstrative concepts which refer to actions by deferring to motor representations?

          <div class="notes">[*cut:
Set that aside, suppose it can be solved --- essentially because MR must give rise to
experience of action.
On this view, it is demonstrative deference to motor representation that connects
intentions to bodily movements.
Only by recognising how intentions interlock with motor representations can we hope to
understand how our intentions ever make a difference to the world around us.
On this view experience of action plays a novel role.
Action experiences in which motor representations feature, such as those associated with
motor imagery and those associated with really acting, are arguably necessary for there to
be concepts which are constituents of intentions and refer to actions by deferring to
motor representations.
But if, as we conjecture, such deference is necessary for intentions to properly and
reliably result in bodily movements, it may turn out that intentionally acting in the
world de- pends on action experiences featuring motor representation.
Much as on some views thought about objects depends on perceptual experience (e.g.
Campbell 2002), so also intending actions may depend on motor experience.

There are no direct inferential connections between intentions and motor

involves a bodily movement, either executing that intention involves
forming a further intention or else the intention involves a demonstrative
that refers to an action by deferring to a motor representation.

perceptual experience (e.g. Campbell 2002), so also intending bodily
actions may ultimately depend on motor experience. Experience anchors the
reflective in the pre-reflective.

          <div class="notes">Mylopoulos and Pacherie object (p. 11): ‘there are no clear examples of intention deferring
to motor representation, which makes it dubious that this ever takes place’
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Our example was: ‘consider purely mental pantomime—that is, phenomenologically
action-like imagination. One might use this kind of imagination to explore
different ways of completing a task and then, having hit on a good
solution, think to oneself ‘Do that!’. It seems possible that in some such
cases the demonstrative refers by deferring to a motor representation of
action involved in imagining acting (135)’
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Mylopoulos and Pacherie reply (p. 11): ‘The obvious problem here is that we need not
suppose that the intention refers to the relevant action by way of deferring to a motor
representation. What seems more likely is that it does so by deferring to the mental image
of the relevant action.’
          </div>
          <div class="notes">But what is a mental image of an action? Maybe it’s nothing other than the
experience that the motor representation gives rise to.  If so, there is no 
real disagreement here.

          <div class="notes">I don’t understand this objection.  One problem is that the analogy seems to require 
only that we have an independent way of picking out the thing referred to.
But this is the action, not the motor representation.
(It is not part of our view that we demonstratively refer to motor representations.)
