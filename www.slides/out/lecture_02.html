to some extent, a full understanding of action will require understanding
interfaces between the two …

Not all representations represent patterns of joint displacements and bodily 
configurations: some represent outcomes such as the grasping of an object, which
may be done in different ways in different contexts.</div>

their action-coordinating role.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Why postulate motor representations at all?  [Dependence of present actions on future actions
is one reason for doing so.]
          </div>
          <div class="slide">
            <div data-what="img.bkg" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div>
            <div class="notes">Suppose you are a cook who needs to take an egg from its box, crack it and put it (except for the
shell) into a bowl ready for beating into a carbonara sauce.
Even for such mundane, routine actions, the constraints on adequate performance can vary
significantly depending on subtle variations in context. For example, the position of a hot pan
may require altering the trajectory along which the egg is transported, or time pressures may mean
that the action must be performed unusually swiftly on this occasion.
Further, many of the constraints on performance involve relations between actions occurring at
different times.
To illustrate, how tightly you need to grip the egg now depends, among other things, on the forces
to which you will subject the egg in lifting it later.
It turns out that people reliably grip objects such as eggs just tightly enough across a range of
conditions in which the optimal tightness of grip varies.
This indicates (along with much other evidence) that information about the cook’s anticipated
future hand and arm movements appropriately influences how tightly she initially grips the egg
(compare \citealp{kawato:1999_internal}).
This anticipatory control of grasp, 
like several other features of action performance (\citealp[see][chapter 1]{rosenbaum:2010_human} for more examples),
is not plausibly a consequence of mindless physiology, nor of intention and practical reasoning.
This is one reason for postulating motor representations, which characteristically play a role in
coordinating sequences of very small scale actions such as grasping an egg in order to lift it.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">[The scale of an actual action can be defined in terms of means-end relations.  
Given two actions which are related as means to ends by the processes and representations 
involved in their performance, the first is smaller in scale than the second just if the 
first is a means to the second.  Generalising, we associate the scale of an actual action 
with the depth of the hierarchy of outcomes that are related to it by the transitive closure 
of the means-ends relation.  Then, generalising further, a repeatable action (something that 
different agents might do independently on several occasions) is associated with a scale 
characteristic of the things people do when they perform that action.  Given that actions 
such as cooking a meal or painting a house count as small-scale actions, actions such as 
grasping an egg or dipping a brush into a can of paint are very-small scale.  Note that we 
do not stipulate a tight link between the very small scale and the motoric.  In some cases 
intentions may play a role in coordinating sequences of very small scale purposive actions, 
and in some cases motor representations may concern actions which are not very small scale.  
The claim we wish to consider is only that, often enough, explaining the coordination of 
sequences of very small scale actions appears to involve representations but not, or not 
only, intentions.  To a first approximation, \emph{motor representation} is a label for 
such representations.%
\footnote{% 
Much more to be said about what motor representations are; for instance, see \citet{butterfill:2012_intention} for the view that motor representations can be distinguished by representational format.

            <div class="notes">‘They are internal models or stored representations that represent generic knowledge
about a certain pattern of action and are implicated in the production and control of
action. For instance, in the influential Motor Schema Theory proposed by Richard Schmidt
(1975, 2003), a motor schema involves a generalized motor program, together with corre-
sponding ‘recall’ and ‘recognition’ schemas. The generalized motor program is thought to
contain an abstract representation defining the general form or pattern of an action,
that is the organization and structure common to a set of motor acts (e.g., invariant
features pertaining to the order of events, their spatial configuration, their relative
timing and the relative force with which they are produced). This generalized motor
program has parameters that control it. In order to determine how an action should be
performed on a given occasion, parameter values adapted to the situation must be
specified. Thus, a motor schema also includes a rule or system of rules describing the
relationships between initial conditions, parameter values and outcomes and allowing us
to perform the action over a large range of conditions (the ‘recall schema’ in Schmidt’s
terminology). Finally, the motor schema also includes a rule or system of rules
describing the relationships between initial conditions, exteroceptive and propri-
oceptive sensory feedback during an action, and action outcome (a recognition sche- ma),
allowing agents to know when they have made an error – i.e., the action does not have
the sensory consequences it is expected to have – and to correct for it.’
            </div>
            <div class="notes">Are motor schemas an alterantive to motor representations? Tempting to think that where
they talk about motor schema, we think of motor representations that represent outcomes
that are relatively distal from action (e.g. are affector-neutral).

            <div class="notes">This would explain why they contrast motor schema with motor programmes. We use ‘motor

              <div class="notes">The experiments providing such evidence typically involve a marker of motor representation, 
such as a pattern of neuronal firings, a motor evoked potential or a behavioural performance 
profile, which, in controlled settings, allows sameness or difference of motor representation 
to be distinguished.  Such markers can be exploited to show that the sameness and difference 
of motor representation is linked to the sameness and difference of an outcome such as the 
grasping of a particular object.
(Pioneering uses of this method include \citealp{rizzolatti:1988_functional,Rizzolatti:2001ug}; 
it has since been developed in many ways: see, for example,

<div class="notes">How do intentions ground the purposiveness of actions? On any standard view, an intention
represents an outcome, causes an action, and does so in a way that would normally facilitate
the outcome’s occurrence. Similarly, some motor representations represent action
outcomes, play a role in generating actions, and do this in a way that normally facilitates
the occurrence of the outcomes represented.  Like intentions, motor representations
ground the directedness of actions to outcomes which are thereby goals of the actions.</div>

          <div class="notes">Now as Elisabeth Pacherie has argued (and I’ve had a go at arguing this in joint work with Corrado Sinigaglia recently too),
motor representations are relevantly similar to intentions.

Of course motor representations differ from intentions in some important ways (as Pacherie also notes).

But they are similar in the respects that matter for explaining the purposiveness of action.
(1) Like intentions, some motor representations represent outcomes (and not merely patters of joint displacement, say).
(2) Like intentions, some motor representations play a role in coordinating multiple more component activities by virtue of their role as elements in hierarchically structured plans.
(3) And, like intentions, some motor representations coordinate these activities in a way that would normally facilitate the outcome’s occurrence.

The claim is not that \emph{all} purposive actions are linked to outcomes by motor representations, just that some are.
In some cases, the purposiveness of an action is grounded in a motor representation of an outcome; in other cases it is grounded in an intention.

And of course in many cases it may be that both intention and motor representation are involved.

Imagine you are in an unfamiliar city and are trying to get to the central station. 
A stranger offers you two routes. Each route could be represented by a distinct line 
on a paper map. The difference between the two lines is a difference in content.

propositional representations differ in format. The format of a representation 
constrains its possible contents. For example, a representation with a cartographic 
format cannot represent what is represented by sentences such as `There could not be a 
mountain whose summit is inaccessible.'\footnote{ Note that the distinction between 
content and format is orthogonal to issues about representational medium. The maps in 
our illustration may be paper map or electronic maps, and the instructions may be spoken, 
signed or written. This difference is one of medium.} The distinction between content and 
format is necessary because, as our illustration shows, each can be varied independently 
of the other.

          <div class="notes">To illustrate, let’s stay with representations of routes.  
Suppose you are given some verbal instructions describing a route. You are then shown a representation of a route on a map and asked whether this is the same route that was verbally described. You are not allowed to find out by following the routes or by imagining following them. 
Special cases aside, answering the question will involve a process of translation because two distinct representational formats are involved, propositional and cartographic. It is not be enough that you could follow either representation of the route. You will also need to be able to translate from at least one representational format into at least one other format.

Because representational formats are typically associated with characteristic performance profiles, it is sometimes possible to infer similarities and differences in representational format from similarities and differences in the processes in which representations feature.

          <div class="notes">To illustrate, suppose that you have a route representation and I want to work out whether it this representation has a cartographic or propositional format.  One way to do this might be to test your performance on different tasks.  If the representation is propositional you are likely to be relatively fast at identifying key landmarks but relatively slow at translating the route into a sequence of compass directions; but the converse will be true if your representation is cartographic.

For this comparison we need to distinguish two ways of imagining seeing. There is a way of 
imagining seeing which phenomenologically is something like seeing except that it does not 
necessarily involve being receptive to stimuli. This way of imagining seeing, sometimes 
called `sensory imagining', is commonly distinguished from cognitive ways of imagining 
seeing which might for example involve thinking about seeing.
It is this way of imagining seeing an object move that we wish to compare with actually 
seeing an object move.

For ordinary subjects, the tasks differ: they are less accurate 
when the hand's position is biomechanically awkward. 
But \citet{Fiori:2012fk} show that the tasks do not so differ for subjects suffering Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which impairs motor representation \citep{parsons:1998_cerebrally}.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">It may be objected that performance differences such as these can be explained without appealing to
a difference in format. After all, rotating a ball involves an action whereas a ball rotating does
not; consequently, imagining the former may be thought to differ from imagining the latter with
respect to the contents of the representations involved. Supposing that there are differences in
content here and in other cases, could these fully explain differences in performance profile? To
see why not, consider two tasks involving mental rotation. Judging the laterality of a rotated
letter is thought to involve phenomenologically vision-like imagination
\citep{jordan:2001_cortical}, whereas judging the laterality of a rotated hand is thought to involve
phenomenologically action-like imagination \citep{parsons:1987_imagined, gentilucci:1998_right}.
Ordinary subjects who are asked to judge the laterality of a hand rotated to various degrees are
less accurate when the hand's position is biomechanically awkward. By contrast, no such effect
occurs for comparable tasks involving letters rather than hands. How could this difference in
performance in imagining hands and letters be explained? Consider the claim that the difference in
performance can be fully explained by a difference in the content of the representations involved.
Initially this might seem plausible because one task involves hands whereas the other involves
letters. However, there are subjects who can perform both tasks but whose performance is not
different for hands and letters \citep{Fiori:2012fk}. These are subjects suffering Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which impairs motor representation \citep{parsons:1998_cerebrally}. Since
ALS and ordinary subjects encounter the same stimuli and perform the same tasks, there seems to be
no reason (other than our hypothesis about a difference in format) to suppose that the two groups'
performance involves representations with different contents. So if the hand-letter difference in
performance were entirely explained by a difference in content, we would expect ALS and ordinary
subjects to exhibit the same difference in performance. But this is not the case. This is an
obstacle to supposing that the hand-letter difference in performance in ordinary subjects could be
explained by appeal to content.

          <div class="notes">So far we have been arguing that motor and visual representations differ in format. Why suppose that
motor representations also differ in format from intentions? Contrast two ways of imagining taking a
shot in basketball, one involving the phenomenologically action-like kind of imagination and the
other involving a cognitive kind of imagination. The contrast we require is roughly between the way
a former player might imagine this and the way that someone who has only ever read about basketball
might imagine it. As we have seen, the way phenomenologically action-like imagination unfolds in
time and the amount of effort it involves will depend on bio-mechanical, dynamical and postural
constraints, among others. These constraints are closely related to those which govern actually
performing such actions \citep{Jeannerod:2001yb}, and some can be altered by acquiring or losing
motor expertise. By contrast no such constraints would be expected always to apply where a cognitive
kind of imagination is involved. In line with the general strategy of inferring differences in
format from differences in characteristic performance profile, we conclude that motor
representations differ in format from those involved in cognitive kinds of imagination, which are
plausibly propositional.

If you asked a similar question about desire and intention, the answer would be

is no surprise that what you intend sometimes nonaccidentally conforms to what you intend.
But we cannot give the same sort of answer in the case of motor representations and

        <div class="notes">On the targets of actions, as Elisabeth has stressed,
motor representations represent not only ways of acting but also targets on which actions
might be performed and some of their features related to possible action outcomes involving
them (for a review see Gallese & Sinigaglia 2011; for discussion see Pacherie 2000, pp.
410-3). For example visually encountering a mug sometimes involves representing features
such as the orientation and shape of its handle in motor terms (Buccino et al. 2009;
Costantini et al. 2010; Cardellicchio et al. 2011; Tucker & Ellis 1998, 2001).

        <div class="notes">One possibility is that the Interface Problem breaks down into questions corresponding 
to these three different components of outcomes.  That is, an account of how the manipuations
specified by intentions and motor representations nonaccidentally match might end up being
quite different from an account of how the targets or forms match.
(I’m not saying this is right, just considering the possibility.)

Importantly this is not currently known.
One possibility is that period adjustments can be made intentionally \citep[as][p.~2599 hint]{fairhurst:2013_being};

    <div class="notes">BACKGROUND:
Because no one can perform two actions without introducing some tiny variation between them, entrainment of any kind depends on continuous monitoring and ongoing adjustments  \citep[p.~976]{repp:2005_sensorimotor}.
% \textcite[p.~976]{repp:2005_sensorimotor}: ‘A fundamental point about SMS is that it cannot be sustained without error correction, even if tapping starts without any asynchrony and continues at exactly the right mean tempo. Without error correction, the variability inherent in any periodic motor activity would accumulate from tap to tap, and the probability of large asynchronies would increase steadily (Hary & Moore, 1987a; Voillaume, 1971; Vorberg & Wing, 1996). The inability of even musically trained participants to stay in phase with a virtual metronome (i.e., with silent beats extrapolated from a metronome) can be demonstrated easily in the synchronization–continuation paradigm by computing virtual asynchronies for the continuation taps. These asynchronies usually get quite large within a few taps, although occasionally, virtual synchrony may be maintained for a while by chance.’
% \citet[p.~407]{repp:2013_sensorimotor}: ‘Error correction is essential to SMS, even in tapping with an isochronous, unperturbed metronome.’
One kind of adjustment is a phase shift, which occurs when one action in a sequence is delayed or brought forwards in time.
Another kind of adjustment is a period shift; that is, an increase or reduction in the speed with which all future actions are performed, or in the delay between all future adjacent pairs of actions.
These two kinds of adjustment,
phase shifts and period shifts,
appear to be made by mechanisms acting independently, so that correcting errors involves a distinctive pattern of overadjustment.%
\footnote{%
See \citet[pp.~474–6]{schulze:2005_keeping}.  \citet{keller:2014_rhythm} suggest, further, that the two kinds of adjustment involve different brain networks.
Note that this view is currently controversial: \citet{loehr:2011_temporal} could be interpreted as providing evidence for a different account of how entrainment is maintained.
}
\citet[p.~987]{repp:2005_sensorimotor} argues, further, that while adjustments involving phase shifts are largely automatic, adjustments involving changes in period are to some extent  controlled.
% (‘two error correction processes, one being largely automatic and operating via phase resetting, and the other being mostly under cognitive control and, presumably, operating via a modulation of the period of an internal timekeeper’ \citep[p.~987{repp:2005_sensorimotor})
One possibility is that period adjustments can be made intentionally \citep[as][p.~2599 hint]{fairhurst:2013_being};
another is that there are a small number of ‘coordinative strategies’ \citep{repp:2008_sensorimotor} between which agents with sufficient skill can intentionally switch in something like the way in which they can intentionally switch from walking to running.

Some changes can be flexibly accommodated motorically without any need for intention
to be involved, or even for the agents to be aware of the change. This includes peturbations
in the apparent direction of motion while drawing \citep{fourneret:1998_limited}.
But other changes may require a change in intention: circumstances may change in such a way

            <div class="notes">Given these two considerations, it seems to me that, in some cases, nonaccidentally successful

            <div class="notes">But this requirement leads us to a question, which I’ve called ‘The Interface Problem’

            <div class="notes">The interface problem is the problem of explaining how there could be nonaccidental matches
between motor representations and intentions.

matching.

            <div class="notes">There’s also an obstacle I haven’t properly considered here yet.
As I said at the start, whereas motor representations are postulates of 
scientific theories, intentions are, well, of less certain origin.
We know what motor representations are because they creatures of our own theories.
But talk about intention seems to be rooted in what philosophers think about
what Ben thinks about what is going on with Ayesha.
Maybe part of what makes the interface problem challenging is that we’re taking
intentions too seriously.

<div class="notes">What do you experience when someone acts?
According to the Action Index Conjecture,
motor representations of outcomes structure 
experiences, imaginings and (prospective) memories
in ways which provide opportunities for attention to actions directed to those outcomes.
Forming intentions concerning an outcome can influence attention to the action,
which can influence the persistence of a motor representation of the outcome.</div>

<div class="notes">Step back and consider the problem more generally. The mind is made up of lots of different, loosely
connected systems that work largely independently of each other. To a certain extent it’s fine for
them to go their own way; and of course since they all get the same inputs (what with being parts of
a single subject), there are limits on how separate the ways the go can be. Still, it’s often good
for them to be aligned, at least eventually.
</div>
<div class="notes">Experience is what enables there to be nonaccidental eventual alignment of largely independent
cognitive systems. This is what experience is for.

One possibility is that we experience only bodily configurations, joint displacements and

For the purposes of this talk, I will assume that this is wrong.
Instead I will assume that we experience not only bodily configurations, joint displacements,
sounds and the rest but also goal-directed actions.

an object’ \citep[p.\ 11]{Leslie:1998zk}. If you imagine using your fingers to track moving objects,

I do want to mention one of the experimental tools that is used to

See \citet[p.\ 59]{scholl:2009_what}:
\begin{quote}
`I suggest that what Pylyshyn’s (2004) experiments show is exactly what they intuitively 
seem to show: We can keep track of the targets in MOT, but not which one is which. 
[...]
all of this seems easily explained [...] by the view 
that MOT is simply realized by split object-based attention to the MOT targets as a set.'
\end{quote}
It is surely right that the existence of MOT does not, all by itself,
provide support for the existence of a system of object indexes.
However, contra what Scholl seems to be suggesting here, the MOT paradigm 
can be adapated to provide such evidence.
Thus, for instance, \citet{horowitz:2010_direction} show that, in a MOT paradigm, observers 
can report the direction of one or two targets without advance knowledge of which 
targets' directions they will be asked to report.)

Perhaps we can answer this question by analogy with the effects of object indexes on experience.
There’s no perceptual modality linked to objects; instead, a system of object indexes appears to
imposes a sort of structure on experience which can influence attention and guide action.

Similarly, if experience of things around you presents possible actions by way of
structuring, what you need to do to act in a certain way is to attend to a particular action

What is experienced is an object, not an action or an outcome.
So the fact that the action lies in the future and the outcome has not yet occurred is no objection.
But the motor representation of the outcome structures the experience of the object in some way.
So the overall character of the experience of the mug differs when an action is represented
motorically compared to when it does not.

          </div>
          <div class="notes">A second objection: intentions and motor representations need to match in situations where 
you merely imagine acting or merely imaginary objects.  In such situations there are no objects
to experience.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Reply: motor representations structure experiences associated with imaginig things as they do
experiences associated with actually perceiving things. To imagine acting on a mug (say), you need
to imagine the mug.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">A third objection: close your eyes, put yourself in a sensory deprivation chamber.
Let your hand rest palm down on a table.
Now intend to turn your hand palm up.
Often enough, the intention will succeed.
But by hypothesis there is nothing you experience (you are in a sensory deprivation chamber).
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Two points in reply to this objection: first, we haven’t removed proprioception and other 
somasomatic senses.  It may be that motor representations structure experiences of the body
just as much as they structure experiences of mere objects.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">But what if you remove somasomatic senses too?  This is likely to impair action, but unlikely 
to make it impossible. Perhaps the ability to act in such situations depends on memory and 
imagination.

          <div class="notes">In conclusion, 
the interface problem is the problem of explaining how there could be nonaccidental matches
between motor representations and intentions.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">The interface problem is complicated by the \textbf{anatomy} of outcomes, the varying \textbf{scales}
at which intentions can specify actions, and by the possibility of nonaccidental \textbf{dynamical} 
matching.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Part (but not all) of the solution to the interface problem may be what I provisionally called
the ‘action index’ conjecture.
According to this conjecture,

action experiences.  But what I am convinced of is that if we are going to solve the interface
problem, we will need to understand the ways in which actions can be experienced and the mechanisms
which make this possible.
