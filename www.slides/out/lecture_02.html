Asked about this I might say, ‘The goal of my actions was not to break the vase
but only to make her laugh, of course.’
In talking about goals in this way I am not talking about mental representations:
I am talking about actual and possible outcomes of an action, things which did or might 
have happened.

        <div class="notes">To answer this question, we would ideally have pairs of scenarios in which the target of an action
is kept constant while the type of action varies.
To the extent that subjects respond appropriately to the difference in type of action, we can be
confident that they can distinguish actions not just by their targets but also by their types.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">This is illustrated here, where you are habituated to a grasping event and the test events are
(a) grasping but with novel kinematics (from a different angle), or (b) a novel goal event (pushing).
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Unfortunately, as far as I know this has not yet been done.
But there are some studies which, although not intended to get at exactly the issue of whether
infants track goals and not just targets of actions, do indirectly shed light on this issue.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">These studies demonstrate competence in goal-tracking from nine months of age, and give us no reason
to doubt that, in simple enough cases, infants might show competence in goal tracking much earlier.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">\citet{Behne:2005dw} created just such pairs of contrasting scenarios.
In one of their contrasts, an experimenter holds a ball out for an infant to grasp and then
either ‘accidentally’ drops it or teasingly pulls it back.
So in each case there is a goal-directed action involving the ball, but in one case the goal
of the action is to pass the ball to the infant whereas in the other case the goal is to
tease the infant.
\citet[Study 2]{Behne:2005dw} found that nine-month-olds (but not six-month-olds)
consistently and appropriately discriminated between these scenarios by, for example,
banging more when the ball was ‘accidentally’ dropped than when it was teasingly retracted.
This and other research
(e.g. \citealp{ambrosini:2013_looking}) suggests that, at least from nine months of age,
infants can indeed distinguish both the type and target of a goal-directed action.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">% \citet{ambrosini:2013_looking} is important: shows that type of grasp and not just target is tracked, implying that anticipatory looking is not merely perceptual animacy.

<div class="notes">The Teleological Stance provides a computational description of goal tracking.
It hinges on the principle that the goals of an action are those outcomes which the means are a
best available way of brining about.
Given this principle, we can infer goals from means by identifying which outcomes the means 
are a best available way of brining about.
But how is this computation performed?</div>

given what the system is for and peculiar to that system.
There is some evidence that goal-tracking 
in infants (and adults) 
is limited by their abilities to act.
Could this be a signature limit of infant goal-tracking?</div>

projecting frontally from the infant (Fig. 2b). If infants grasped for the objects with their
le hand, we reversed the red right­angled triangle from one side to the other side and
calculated the angle α in the same way. e angle α value of 90° corresponded to a perfect
alignment of the hands in a two­handed reach. Therefore, the angle α value deviates from 90°
towards 180°, and bigger angle α value indicates more mature one­handed grasping. If the
angle α was over 90°, the infant was considered to be engaged in a one­handed grasping

On this View, there’s no obvious reason why

<div class="notes">How do infants (and adults) track the goals of others’ actions?
According to the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking, it is sometimes* by 
means of motor processes.
More carefully, the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking consists of these claims: 
(1) in action observation, possible outcomes of observed actions are represented motorically;
(2) these representations trigger motor processes much as if the observer were performing actions
directed to the outcomes;
(3) such processes generates predictions;
(4) a triggering representation is weakened if the predictions it generates fail.
The result is that, often enough, the only only outcomes to which the observed action is a means
are represented strongly.

(*‘sometimes’ because the Motor Theory is part of a dual-process account of goal-tracking.)</div>

          <p class="center">The Double Life of Motor Representation</p>
          <div class="notes">Suppose you are reaching for, grasping, transporting and then placing a pen. Performing even
relatively simple action sequences like this involves satisfying many constraints that cannot
normally be satisfied by explicit practical reasoning, especially if performance is to be rapid and
fluent. Rather, such performances require motor representations.
These representations are paradigmatically involved in preparing, executing and monitoring actions.%
\footnote{%
See \citet{wolpert:1995internal, miall:1996_forward, jeannerod:1998nbo, zhang:2007_planning}.
Note that motor representations sometimes occur in an agent who has prepared an action and is required (as it turns out) not to perform it: although she has prevented herself from acting, motor representations specifying the action persist, perhaps because they are necessary for monitoring whether prevention has succeeded \citep{bonini:2014_ventral}.
}
But they also live a double life. Motor representations concerning a particular type of action are
involved not only in performing an action of that type but also sometimes in observing one. That is,
if you were to observe Ayesha reach for, grasp, transport and then place a pen, motor representations
would occur in you much like those that would also occur in you if it were you---not Ayesha---who was
doing this.

To utter a phoneme is to produce complex coordinated movements of the

-- such planning generates predictions
-- a triggering representation is weakened if its predictions fail
The result is that the only only outcomes to which the observed action is a means
are represented strongly.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">There is evidence that a motor representation of an outcome can cause a determination of which
movements are likely to be performed to achieve that outcome \citep[see, for
instance,][]{kilner:2004_motor, urgesi:2010_simulating}. Further, the processes involved in
determining how observed actions are likely to unfold given their outcomes are closely related,
or identical, to processes involved in performing actions.
This is known in part thanks to studies of how observing actions can facilitate performing
actions congruent with those observed, and can interfere with performing incongruent actions
\citep{
	brass:2000_compatibility, 
	craighero:2002_hand, 
	kilner:2003_interference, 
	costantini:2012_does}. 
Planning-like processes in action observation have also been demonstrated by measuring observers' predictive gaze.  If you were to observe just the early phases of a grasping movement, your eyes might jump to its likely target, ignoring nearby objects \citep{ambrosini:2011_grasping}. These proactive eye movements resemble those you would typically make if you were acting yourself \citep{Flanagan:2003lm}. 
Importantly, the occurrence of such proactive eye movements in action observation depends on your
representing the outcome of an action motorically; even temporary interference in the observer's
motor abilities will interfere with the eye movements \citep{Costantini:2012fk}.
These proactive eye movements also depend on planning-like processes; requiring the observer to
perform actions incongruent with those she is observing can eliminate proactive eye movements
\citep{Costantini:2012uq}. This, then, is further evidence for planning-like motor processes in
action observation.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">So observers represent outcomes motorically and these representations trigger planning-like processes
which generate expectations about how the observed actions will unfold and their sensory consequences.
Now the mere occurrence of these processes is not sufficient to explain why, in action observation,
an outcome represented motorically is likely to be an outcome to which the observed action is
directed.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">To take a tiny step further, we conjecture that, in action observation, \textbf{motor representations of
outcomes are weakened to the extent that the expectations they generate are unmet}
\citep[compare][]{Fogassi:2005nf}.
A motor representation of an outcome to which an observed action is not directed is likely to
generate incorrect expectations about how this action will unfold, and failures of these
expectations to be met will weaken the representation.
This is what ensures that there is a correspondence between outcomes represented motorically in
observing actions and the goals of those actions.

processes in the way in which goal-tracking does. 
However, we should probably be cautious here; in pilot research with Jason Low, we have some
preliminary evidence that some theory of mind abilities may be more closely tied to motor processes

This contradicts both the Simple View and the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking.

A further puzzle arises from the fact that goal-tracking sometimes manifests in dishabitution or

  <div class="notes">Let me recap how we got here and why this is puzzling.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">I started by asking, How 9-month-olds track can goals?
The Simple View offers one answer: 
the principles comprising the Teleological Stance are things they know or believe, and they are able
to track goals by making inferences from these principles.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">I suggested that the Simple View should be rejected because it cannot explain why infants’
abilities to track goals are limited by their abilities to perform actions.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">At least, mTga provides a better alternative to the Simple View.
According to mTga,
Infants’ pure goal-tracking depends on the double life of motor processes.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">mTga correctly predicts that infants’ pure goal-tracking should be limited by infants’
abilities to act ...
  </div>

    <div data-what=".notall" data-cls="transition-04" class="dv dv-addclass"></div>
    <div data-what=".notall" data-cls="bkg-red" class="dv dv-addclass"></div>
    <div class="notes">But, unfortunately, there appear to be cases in which infants’ pure goal-tracking
is not limited by their abilities to act, and this is contrary to mTga.
    </div>
    <div class="notes">The puzzle, then, to explain how infants can track goals if neither the Simple View
nor mTga is correct.
    </div>
    <div class="notes">Even worse, 
there’s another, apparently unrelated puzzle to explain too ...

both anticipatory looking and dishabituation.

        <div class="notes">where researchers have measured two different responses to a single
scenario, anticipatory looking and either dishabituation or pupil dilation.
Generally, they appear to find evidence for goal tracking in dishabituation
or pupil dilation but not in anticipatory looking.

where adults are given a simple visual task such as identifying which circle is the ‘wolf’
and which the ‘sheep’, or, in another experiment, moving the sheep around in order to 
avoid being caught by the wolf.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">It is also possible to examine how having a sheep and a wolf affects how attention is allocated by
measuring how well participants can detect probes placed on different shapes.

        <div class="notes">The literature on perceptual animacy mostly confounds it with goal tracking.
But there are two key differences.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">First, perceptual animacy is a broadly
perceptual phenomenon.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Second,
the perceptual detection of animacy is clearly distinct from goal tracking
for it involves detecting relations between objects in motion rather than
outcomes to which actions are directed.
Relatedly, it does not involve sensitivity to the type of action.
And the perceptual detection of animacy appears to depend on simple cues
and heuristics and is unlikely to be correctly described by the
Teleological Stance.
So perceptual animacy does not involve tracking goals to which an action is
directed: it is a matter of tracking objects to which animate movements are
directed.

the detection by broadly perceptual processes of animate objects and their targets.
To illustrate, consider a groundbreaking experiment by \citet[experiment 1]{gao:2009_psychophysics}.
Adults were shown a display which contained some moving circles.
In some cases the circles moved independently of each other, but in other cases there was a ‘wolf’
which chased a ‘sheep’ with varying degrees of subtlety.
The adults’ task was simply to detect the presence of a wolf.
\citeauthor{gao:2009_psychophysics} established that adults can do this providing the chasing is not too subtle.
In further experiments, they also showed that adults’ abilities to perceptually detect chasing
depend on several cues including whether the chaser ‘faces’ its target (‘directionality’) and how
directly the chaser approaches its target (‘subtlety’).
The detection of animacy appears to be a broadly perceptual phenomena since it depends on areas of
the brain associated with vision and influences how perceptual attention is allocated
\citep{scholl:2013_perceiving} irrespective of your beliefs and intentions
\citep{buren:2016_automaticity}.

          <div class="notes">The perceptual detection of animacy resembles goal tracking, for it involves detecting a relation
between a chaser and its target.
However the perceptual detection of animacy is clearly distinct from goal tracking.%
\footnote{%
Contrast \citet{schlottmann:2010_goal,Scholl:2000eq} who all claim that perceptual animacy is a matter of, or involves, tracking goals.
}
For one thing, it involves detecting relations between objects in motion rather than outcomes to
which actions are directed.
Relatedly, it does not involve sensitivity to the type of action.
Finally, the perceptual detection of animacy appears to depend on simple cues and heuristics and is
unlikely to be correctly described by the Teleological Stance.
For these reasons, we should distinguish the perceptual detection of animacy from tracking goals to which actions are directed.

The conjecture I have formulated suggests a solution: perhaps perceptual animacy is sometimes
responsible for pupil dilation and dishabituation; but never responsible for proactive gaze.

            <div class="notes">Pupil dilation at 6 and 12-months of age; unlike proactive gaze, it  does not 
correlate with experience of being fed; but it isn’t plausibly perceptual animacy either.
(Why would perceptual animacy predict a difference between spoon going to mouth or hand?)
Instead it may be a consequence of associative learning about the typical sequence
of chunks of actions.

          <p class="huge-glow-120 center">Conclusion</p>
          <div class="notes">My question was, How can infants in the first 9 months of life track goals?
Given that infants’ goal-tracking is limited by their abilities to perform actions,
I proposed to answer this question by appeal to the mTgt:
Infants’ pure goal-tracking, like much of adults’, depends on the double life of motor processes.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">This yielded a simple dual-process theory of goal-tracking.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">But this is much too simple, as
findings on infants’ goal-tracking in the first 9 months of life confronts us with a puzzle.
For they appear to show that, in many cases, infants can track the goals of actions 
performed by cartoon fish and spheres; and these are clearly actions that no infant (or adult)
could perform.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Apparantly, then, we must reject the mTgt. But if we do that, it seems we lack any way of 
explaining why infants’ goal-tracking is so often limited by their abilities to act.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">The solution, I suggested, is to invoke perceptual animacy.
That is what led me to this conjecture ...

          </p>
          <p class="hem-above">appearances that goal-tracking is not limited by their abilities to act

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="notes">This conjecture is quite bold, but I think it’s one worth betting on partly because,
as I suggested, it generates readily testable predictions.
    </div>
    <div class="notes">This conjecture also has another virtue.
Goal-tracking is so fundamental to social cognition and joint action that it is 
likely to depend on a rich mix of many kinds of processes, including associative learning.
We need ways to identify these processes, to distinguish their limits and to understand their 
synergies.
Distinguishing motor processes which support goal-tracking by realising the Teleological Stance 
from perceptual animacy is a step towards meeting this need.
    </div>
    <div class="notes">So how does this bear on the conference topic,
Action Perception?
In short, there isn’t any.
At least not if actions are goal-directed actions.
    </div>
    <div class="notes">Why do I say this?  Not because I can rule out the possibility of action perception, of course.
But goal-tracking is like speech perception in this sense: in both cases, the best supported,
most carefully developed theories are not about perceptual processes but about motor processes.

  <div class="notes">That, anyway, is my conclusion.
The double life of motor processes underpins humans’ earliest 
pure goal-tracking, and so provides a basis for the many and varied forms of social cognition,
including mindreading, which depend on pure goal-tracking.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">Many will disagree with this.
What I hope we will agree about, though, is that solving the developmental puzzle
about pure-goal tracking is essential if we care at all about the abilities
which underpin humans’ capacities for social cognition and joint action.
