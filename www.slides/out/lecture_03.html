        <div class="notes">Below you see the transitions, , i.e. the parts of the spectrogram that differ between [ra] and [la].
When played in isolation these sound like a chirp. When played at the same time as the base but in
the other ear, subjects hear a chirp and a [ra] or a [la] depending on which transition is played.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">How do we know that the same stimuli may be processed by different perceptual systems
concurrently—for instance, how do we know that speech and auditory processing are distinct? A
phenomenon called “duplex” perception demonstrates their distinctness occurs in. Artificial
speech-like stimuli for two syllables, [ra] and [la], are generated. The acoustic signals for each
syllable is artificially broken up into two parts, the “base” and “transition” (see Fig. *** below).
The syllables have the same “base” but differ in the “transition”. When the “transition” is played
alone it sounds like a chirp and quite unlike anything we normally hear in speech. Duplex perception
occurs when the base and transition are played together but in separate ears. In this case, subjects
hear both the chirp that they hear when the transition is played in isolated, and the syllable [la]
or [ra]. Which syllable they hear depends on which transition is played, so speech processing must
have combined the base and transition. By contrast, auditory processing must have failed to combine
them because otherwise the chirp would not have been heard. In this case, then, the perception
resulting from the duplex presentation involves simultaneous auditory and speech recognition
processes. This shows that auditory and speech processing are distinct perceptual processes.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The duplex case is unusual. We can’t normally hear the chirps we make in speaking because speech
processing inhibits this level of auditory processing. But plainly speech is subject to some auditory
processing for we can hear extra-linguistic qualities of speech; some of these provide cues to
emotional state, gender and class. Perception of these extra-linguistic qualities enables us to
distinguish stimuli within a category. As already mentioned, this is a problem for Repp’s operational
definition. Our ability to discriminate stimuli is the product of both categorical speech processing
and non-categorical auditory processing. If we want to get at the essence of categorical perception
it seems there is no alternative but to appeal to particular perceptual processes rather than
behaviours.

        <div class="notes">Here is the argument. Consider two sequences of sensory encounters: (a) a sequence of sensory
encounters with two phonetic events that do not differ with respect to category (both are
realisations of /d/, say), and (b) a sequence of sensory encounters with two phonetic events that do
so differ (one is a realisation of /d/ the other of /g/, say).11 Let the events encountered in the
first sequence differ from each other acoustically in the same way and by the same amount as the
events encountered in the second sequence differ from each other. (That it is possible to find two
such pairs of events follows from the fact that we enjoy categorical perception of speech.) The two
sequences are depicted in Fig. 3. Now:

          <p class="slide">(2) This difference in differences in phenomenal character is a fact in need of explanation.</p>
          <p class="slide">(3) The difference cannot be fully explained by appeal only to perceptual experiences as of acoustic features of the stimuli; after all, the stimuli encountered in each sequence, (a) and (b), differ equally in this respect.</p>
          <p class="slide">(4) The difference can be explained in terms of perceptual experiences as of phonetic properties if the above thesis is true for categorical perception of speech (how the explanation works is specified below).</p>
          <p class="slide">(5) There is no better explanation of the difference.</p>
          <div class="notes">The fourth step in this argument, (4), needs some filling in. How would the thesis that categorical
perception of speech is a form of perceptual experience explain the difference in differences in
phenomenal character? If the thesis is true, the first sequence of sensory encounters, (a), involves
two perceptual experiences as of a single phoneme whereas the second sequence of encounters, (b),
involves perceptual experiences as of different phonemes.12 Let us assume (not very controversially)
that perceptual experiences have phenomenal characters and that which phenomenal character a
perceptual experience has depends in part on what it is as of.13 It follows that differences in what
perceptual experiences are as of can explain differences in the phenomenal characters of those
perceptual experiences. In particular, if it is a fact that (b) involves perceptual experiences as
of different things whereas (a) does not, this could explain why the sensory encounters in (b)
differ in phenomenal character in a way that the sensory encounters in (a) do not.

Prelinguistic infants’ categorical perception is adult-like in the sense that it is subject to
complex effects of speaker and context on where perceptual category boundaries fall (Kuhl 1987:
376–82, 2004: 834). Infants’ categorical perception also plays an important role in language
acquisition (Eimas, Siqueland, et al. 1971; Jusczyk 1995; Saffran, Newport and Aslin 1996).

        <div class="notes">Consider perceptually-based beliefs involving demonstrative concepts such as the belief that This
phoneme is that phoneme. Children’s and adults’ untrained judgements about phonemes are often
surprisingly inaccurate, and they are typically influenced by acoustic features such as sonority as
well as their knowledge of spelling and linguistic structure (Scarborough, Ehri, et al. 1998;
Treiman and Cassar 1997; Lehtonen and Treiman 2007; Hallé, Chéreau and Segui 2000). In addition,
children tend to systematically misidentify phonemes depending on the context in which they appear
(Treiman 1985: 197). Categorical perception is not similarly affected by these factors (Serniclaes,
Ventura, et al. 2005). This is evidence for the view that whereas categorical perception tracks
articulatory gestures, demonstrative concepts track some sort of hybrid acoustic-
linguistic properties.20 This view is further supported by the fact that untrained subjects
sometimes regard their phonetic beliefs as beliefs about the sounds which make up words (compare
Scarborough, Ehri, et al. 1998: 119–20 on ‘little sounds’).

          <div class="notes">How does this bear on Tye’s claim that perceptual experiences stand “ready and available to make a
direct impact on beliefs”? This claim implies that in good circumstances and where background
conditions are met, the properties subjects enjoy perceptual experiences as of are also properties
they can think about. Suppose categorical perception of speech were a form of perceptual experience.
In that case, subjects would enjoy perceptual experiences as of articulatory gestures (or as of
events or properties matching these in extension). Despite this, they fail to be able to think about
any such properties, for, as we have seen, there is a large and systematic discrepancy between the
boundaries of their perceptual categories and the extensions of the concepts involved in their
judgements, even the simplest perceptually-based demonstrative judgements. All by itself this
discrepancy carries little weight. For Tye’s claim about perceptual experiences making a direct
impact on beliefs must allow for the possibilities of interference and inhibition from false
beliefs. And in the case of categorical perception of speech, there is evidence that both
interference and relevant false beliefs are present. But, crucially, these factors do not fully
explain the extent of the discrepancies between categorical perception and belief (see footnote 20).
Rather it appears that whereas categorical perception tracks one type of thing (articulatory
gestures), demonstrative concepts track something altogether different (little sounds, perhaps). So
if categorical perception of speech did involve perceptual experiences as of acoustic properties,
its existence would be evidence against Tye’s claim that perceptual experiences stand “ready and
available to make a direct impact on beliefs.”

          <div class="notes">footnote 20: There are two alternative possible explanations for the discrepancies between
categorical perception and phonetic judgements: subjects may find it difficult to attend to phonetic
properties, and they may find it difficult to inhibit tendencies to make judgements on the basis of
orthography. While both claims may be true (first claim: Treiman 1985: 199–200; second claim:
Scarborough, Ehri, et al. 1998: 138), they do not fully explain the discrepancies.

          <div class="notes">What is a phenomenal expectation?  Consider a second illustration.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Here is a wire.
Contrast two sensory encounters with this wire. In the first you visually 
experience the wire as having a certain shape. In the second you receive an 
electric shock from the wire without seeing or touching it.%
\footnote{This illustration is borrowed from Campbell (2002: 133–4); I use it to support a claim weaker than his.}
The first sensory encounter involves perceptual experience as of a property of
the wire whereas, intuitively, the second does not. 
I take this intuition to be correct.%
\footnote{
Notice that the intuition is not that the shock involves no 
perceptual experience at all, only that the shock does not involve 
perceptual experience as of any property of the wire. Notice also that the 
intuition concerns what a perceptual experience is as of, and not directly 
what is represented in perception. The relation between these two is 
arguably not straightforward (compare, e.g., \citet[p.~28]{Shoemaker:1994el} or 
\citet[pp.~50--2]{Chalmers:2006xq} on distinguishing representational from 
phenomenal content).
}
          </div>
          <div class="notes">The intuition is potentially revealing because the electric shock involves 
rich phenomenology, and its particular phenomenal character depends in part 
on properties of its cause (changes in the strength of the electric current 
would have resulted in an encounter with different phenomenal character). 
So there are sensory encounters which, despite having phenomenal characters 
that depend in part on which properties are encountered, are not perceptual 
experiences as of those properties.

When you see this face, you have a feeling of familiarity.
This feeling of familiarity is not just a matter of belief:
even if you know for sure that you have never encountered the person
depicted here (and trust me, you haven’t), the feeling of familiarity
will persist.
Nor is the feeling a matter of perceptual experience: you can’t 
perceptually experience familiarity
any more than you can perceptually experience electricity.

          <div class="notes">(The face is a composite of Bush and Obama.  It is chosen to illustrate that
the feeling of familiarity is not a consequence of how familiar things 
actually are; instead it may be a consequnece of 
the degree of fluency with which unconscious processes can identify 
perceived items \citep{Whittlesea:1993xk,Whittlesea:1998qj}.
Learning a grammar can also generate feelings of familiarity.
Subjects who have implicitly learned an artificial grammar report feelings 
of familiarity when they encounter novel stimuli that are part of 
the learnt grammar \citep{scott:2008_familiarity}.
They are also not doomed to treat feelings of familiarity as being
about actual familiarity:
instead subjects can use feeling of 
familiarity in deciding whether a stimulus is from that grammar 
\citep{Wan:2008_familiarity}.)

with familiarity.
These feelings are paradigm cases of phenomenal expectation.

Even if you don’t believe that there are sensations in Reid’s sense,
thinking of phenomenal expectations as if they were sensations will
serve to illustrate their characteristic features.
The main points that follow are consistent with several different ways of
thinking about phenomenal expectations.
For instance, you might take the view that 
what I am calling phenomenal expectations are
perceptual experiences of the body or of bodily reactions,
or that they involve some kind of cognitive phenomenology.
The essential claim is just that the phenomenal expectations associated with
the operations of object indexes are not constituted by states which involve
intentional relations to any of the things which are assigned an object index.

(\citealp[Essay~II, Chap.~16, p.~228]{Reid:1785cj}
\citealp[Chap.~VI sect.~III, pp.~164–5]{Reid:1785nz}).
Let me explain.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">As a scientist, you can pick out the feeling of familiarity as that
phenomenal expectation which is normally caused by the degree to which
certain processes are fluent.
But as the subject of who has that phenomenal expectation, you do not 
necessarily know what its typical causes are.
This is something you have to work out in whatever ways you work out
the causes of any other type of event.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">(Contrast phenomenal expectations with perceptual experiences.
Having 
a perceptual experience of, say, a wire’s shape, involves standing
in an intentional relation to the wire’s shape; and the phenomenal
character of this perceptual experience is specified by this 
intentional relation.%
\footnote{
Compare \citet[p.~380]{Martin:2002yx}:
‘I attend to what it is like for me to inspect the lavender bush through 
perceptually attending to the bush itself.’ 
And \citet[p.~211]{byrne:2001_intentionalism}
‘subject can only discover the phenomenal character of her experience by 
attending to the world ... as her experience represents it.’
}
Such perceptual experiences are often held to reveal the wire’s shape to the 
subject and so lead directly to beliefs.%
\footnote{
Compare \citet[p.~222]{Johnston:1992zb}:
‘[j]ustified belief … is available simply on the basis of visual perception’;
\citet[p.~143–4]{Tye:1995oa}:
‘Phenomenal character “stands ready … to make a direct impact on beliefs’;
and
\citet[p.~291]{Smith:2001iz}:
‘[p]erceptual experiences are … intrinsically … belief-inducing.’
})
            </div>
            <div class="notes">(By contrast, having a phenomenal expectation concerning familiarity or an
physical object’s path does not involve standing in any intentional relation
to these things.
The phenomenal expectation is individuated by its normal causes, rather 
than by any intentional relation.
And a phenomenal expectation leads to belief, if at all, only indirectly.
For learning is required in order for the subject to come to a view on
what tends to cause the phenomenal expectation.)
            </div>
            <div class="notes">Phenomenal expectations have been quite widely neglected in philosophy and
developmental psychology.
They are a means by which cognitive processes enable perceivers to 
acquire dispositions to form beliefs about objects’ properties which are 
reliably true.    
Phenomenal expectations provide a low-cost but efficient bridge between 
non-conscious cognitive processes and conscious reasoning.
