to be the A-outcomes. Another way of matching is for the B-outcomes to stand to the A-outcomes as
elements of a more detailed plan stand to those of a less detailed one.

If you asked a similar question about desire and intention, the answer would be

is no surprise that what you intend sometimes nonaccidentally conforms to what you intend.
But we cannot give the same sort of answer in the case of motor representations and

Similarly, intentions do not feature in motor processes.

<div class="notes notes-header-tex">\section{The Motor Theory of Goal Tracking (recap)}</div>
<div class="notes">How do humas track the goals of others’ actions?
According to the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking, it is sometimes* by 
means of motor processes.
More carefully, the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking consists of these claims: 
(1) in action observation, possible outcomes of observed actions are represented motorically;
(2) these representations trigger motor processes much as if the observer were performing actions
directed to the outcomes;
(3) such processes generates predictions;
(4) a triggering representation is weakened if the predictions it generates fail.
The result is that, often enough, the only only outcomes to which the observed action is a means
are represented strongly.

(*‘sometimes’ because the Motor Theory is part of a dual-process account of goal-tracking.)</div>

          <div class="notes">Two forms of goal ascription, representational and functional (\citealp{gallese:2011_what}).
In \emph{representational goal ascription}, three things must be represented: an action, an outcome and the relation between this outcome and the action in virtue of which the outcome is a goal of the action.
% jacob:2012_sharing: ‘Ascribing a goal to an agent consists in forming a belief (or judgment) about an agent that he or she has a goal or is performing some goal-directed action.’
In \emph{functional goal ascription}, the relation between action and outcome is captured without being represented.
To say that this relation is \emph{captured} is to say that there is a process which ensures that the outcome represented is a goal of the action.

            <div class="notes">Motor representations cannot suffice for representational goal ascription. 
It is true that, in someone observing an action there can be motor representations of outcomes which, non accidentally, are the goals of the observed action.
But this is not enough.
There would have to be, in addition, a motor representation of an intention, or of a motor representation or of some other goal-state, or of a function. 
But there are no such motor representations.

          <div class="notes">How does it ever come about that an outcome represented motorically in observing an action is an outcome to which that action is directed?
First consider a parallel question about performing rather than observing actions.
Suppose you are alone and not observing or imagining any other actions.
When performing actions in this situation, outcomes represented motorically in you will normally be
among the goals of your actions; that is, they will be outcomes to which your actions are directed.
What ensures this correspondence between outcomes represented and goals?

            <p>Because planning-like processes.</p>
            <div class="notes">It is the role of the
representation in controlling how the action unfolds. Representations of outcomes trigger
planning-like motor processes whose function is to cause actions that will bring about the outcomes
represented \citep{miall:1996_forward,arbib:1985_coordinated,rosenbaum:2012_cognition}.

actions but also to predict them.

        <div class="notes">There is evidence that a motor representation of an outcome can cause a determination of which movements are likely to be performed to achieve that outcome \citep[see, for instance,][]{kilner:2004_motor, urgesi:2010_simulating}. Further, the processes involved in determining how observed actions are likely to unfold given their outcomes are closely related, or identical, to processes involved in performing actions. 
This is known in part thanks to studies of how observing actions can facilitate performing actions congruent with those observed, and can interfere with performing incongruent actions \citep{
	brass:2000_compatibility, 
	craighero:2002_hand, 
	kilner:2003_interference, 
	costantini:2012_does}. 
Planning-like processes in action observation have also been demonstrated by measuring observers' predictive gaze.  If you were to observe just the early phases of a grasping movement, your eyes might jump to its likely target, ignoring nearby objects \citep{ambrosini:2011_grasping}. These proactive eye movements resemble those you would typically make if you were acting yourself \citep{Flanagan:2003lm}. 
Importantly, the occurrence of such proactive eye movements in action observation depends on your
representing the outcome of an action motorically; even temporary interference in the observer's
motor abilities will interfere with the eye movements \citep{Costantini:2012fk}.
These proactive eye movements also depend on planning-like processes; requiring the observer to
perform actions incongruent with those she is observing can eliminate proactive eye movements
\citep{Costantini:2012uq}. This, then, is further evidence for planning-like motor processes in
action observation.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">So observers represent outcomes motorically and these representations trigger planning-like processes
which generate expectations about how the observed actions will unfold and their sensory consequences.
Now the mere occurrence of these processes is not sufficient to explain why, in action observation,
an outcome represented motorically is likely to be an outcome to which the observed action is
directed.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">To take a tiny step further, we conjecture that, in action observation, \textbf{motor representations of
outcomes are weakened to the extent that the expectations they generate are unmet}
\citep[compare][]{Fogassi:2005nf}.
A motor representation of an outcome to which an observed action is not directed is likely to
generate incorrect expectations about how this action will unfold, and failures of these
expectations to be met will weaken the representation.
This is what ensures that there is a correspondence between outcomes represented motorically in
observing actions and the goals of those actions.

<div class="notes">Motor representations live a kind of double life. Although paradigmatically involved in performing
actions, they also occur when merely observing others act and sometimes influence thoughts about the
goals of observed actions. Further, these influences are content-respecting: what you think about an
action sometimes depends in part on how that action is represented motorically in you.</div>

<!-- param @cls and param @options should be objects-->




<div class="notes">- - - - - - - -

<div class="notes">Suppose you are reaching for, grasping, transporting and then placing a pen. Performing even
relatively simple action sequences like this involves satisfying many constraints that cannot
normally be satisfied by explicit practical reasoning, especially if performance is to be rapid and
fluent. Rather, such performances require motor representations.
These representations are paradigmatically involved in preparing, executing and monitoring actions.%
\footnote{%
See \citet{wolpert:1995internal, miall:1996_forward, jeannerod:1998nbo, zhang:2007_planning}.
Note that motor representations sometimes occur in an agent who has prepared an action and is required (as it turns out) not to perform it: although she has prevented herself from acting, motor representations specifying the action persist, perhaps because they are necessary for monitoring whether prevention has succeeded \citep{bonini:2014_ventral}.
}
But they also live a double life. Motor representations concerning a particular type of action are
involved not only in performing an action of that type but also sometimes in observing one. That is,
if you were to observe Ayesha reach for, grasp, transport and then place a pen, motor representations
would occur in you much like those that would also occur in you if it were you---not Ayesha---who was
doing this.

practical reasoning. But motor representation, unlike belief and intention, does not feature in
practical reasoning. Indeed, thought is inferentially isolated from it. How then could any motor

<div class="notes">What do you experience when someone acts?
According to the Action Index Conjecture,
motor representations of outcomes structure 
experiences, imaginings and (prospective) memories
in ways which provide opportunities for attention to actions directed to those outcomes.
Forming intentions concerning an outcome can influence attention to the action,
which can influence the persistence of a motor representation of the outcome.</div>

<div class="notes">Step back and consider the problem more generally. The mind is made up of lots of different, loosely
connected systems that work largely independently of each other. To a certain extent it’s fine for
them to go their own way; and of course since they all get the same inputs (what with being parts of
a single subject), there are limits on how separate the ways the go can be. Still, it’s often good
for them to be aligned, at least eventually.

          <div class="notes">what is an object index? Formally, an object index is ‘a mental token that functions as a pointer to
an object’ \citep[p.\ 11]{Leslie:1998zk}. If you imagine using your fingers to track moving objects,
an object index is the mental counterpart of a finger \citep[p.~68]{pylyshyn:1989_role}.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">The interesting thing about object indexes is that a system of object
indexes (at least one, maybe more)
appears to underpin cognitive processes which are not
strictly perceptual but also do not involve beliefs or knowledge states.
While I can’t fully explain the evidence for this claim here,
I do want to mention one of the experimental tools that is used to
investigate the existence of, and the principles underpinning, 
a system of object indexes which operates 
between perception and thought ...

a system of object indexes has been challenged.  
See \citet[p.\ 59]{scholl:2009_what}:
\begin{quote}
`I suggest that what Pylyshyn’s (2004) experiments show is exactly what they intuitively 
seem to show: We can keep track of the targets in MOT, but not which one is which. 
[...]
all of this seems easily explained [...] by the view 
that MOT is simply realized by split object-based attention to the MOT targets as a set.'
\end{quote}
It is surely right that the existence of MOT does not, all by itself,
provide support for the existence of a system of object indexes.
However, contra what Scholl seems to be suggesting here, the MOT paradigm 
can be adapated to provide such evidence.
Thus, for instance, \citet{horowitz:2010_direction} show that, in a MOT paradigm, observers 
can report the direction of one or two targets without advance knowledge of which 
targets' directions they will be asked to report.)

But given the distinct shapes and textures of these things, it seems all but certain that there must be two objects.

            <div class="notes">What do we experience when someone acts?
Perhaps we can answer this question by analogy with the effects of object indexes on experience.
There’s no perceptual modality linked to objects; instead, a system of object indexes appears to
imposes a sort of structure on experience which can influence attention and guide action.

Similarly, if experience of things around you presents possible actions by way of
structuring, what you need to do to act in a certain way is to attend to a particular action
possibility structure.

        <div class="notes">The second part of the answer to the objection is that motor representations of 
outcomes may structure our experiences of objects.
The existence of affordances suggests that this is at least possible.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">So here is the idea:
What is experienced is an object, not an action or an outcome.
So the fact that the action lies in the future and the outcome has not yet occurred is no objection.
But the motor representation of the outcome structures the experience of the object in some way.
So the overall character of the experience of the mug differs when an action is represented
motorically compared to when it does not.

to experience.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Reply: motor representations structure experiences associated with imaginig things as they do
experiences associated with actually perceiving things. To imagine acting on a mug (say), you need
to imagine the mug.

          <div class="notes">A third objection: close your eyes, put yourself in a sensory deprivation chamber.
Let your hand rest palm down on a table.
Now intend to turn your hand palm up.
Often enough, the intention will succeed.
But by hypothesis there is nothing you experience (you are in a sensory deprivation chamber).

          <div class="notes">Two points in reply to this objection: first, we haven’t removed proprioception and other

just as much as they structure experiences of mere objects.
