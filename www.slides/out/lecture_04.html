<div class="notes">While many findings indicate that four month old human infants
can track simple causal interactions, other evidence suggests
that two year olds have systematic difficulties tracking causal
interactions.
As many researchers have noted, this may motivate appeal to a 
dual process account (or one involving ‘core knowledge’ or ‘modularity’).</div>

        <div class="notes">Consider this case where a ball falls and lands on a bench.
Suppose that there was a barrier in front of the bench, like the dotted line.
Because the bench protrudes from the barrier, you could easily see where the ball will land.
But of course you can only see this if you know that barriers stop solid balls.
Spelke used this observation to provide evidence that 4-month-old infants can track objects' causal interactions.

the screen came forwards and the ball was revealed to be on the ground,

After habituation infants were shown one of two displays.

          <div class="notes">What should we predict?
If infants were only paying attention to the shapes and ignoring properties
like solid, they should have dishabituated more to the consistent than to
the inconsistent stimlus.
After all, that stimlus is more different from the habituation stimulus in
terms of the surfaces.
But if infants were are to track some simple causal interactions, then they
might dishabituate to the 'inconsistent' stimulus more than to the
'consistent' stimulus because that one involves an apparent violation of a
physical laws.

much as adults do \citep{Leslie:1987nr}.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">[nb: Several people have discussed this in seminars so I won't discuss it here (the reference is on your handout).]
        </div>
        <div class="notes">In their experiment, they compared two groups of infants.
The first group was habituated to the top display, which is just the sort of animation Michotte
used to get reports of causal experiences in adults.
After habituation, this first group was then shown the same display except that the direction was 
reversed.
Meanwhile a second group was habituated to a display like the top display here except 
that there was a delay between the first object stopping and the second object starting.
This delay would mean that, in adults, there are no reports of experiences of a causal interaction.
After habituation, this second group was shown the same display except that the direction of 
movement was reversed.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Of interest was whether the first group showed greater dishabituation to the reversal than 
the second group.
How could this tell us anything about infants' experiences?
Suppose that infants do not have anything like what adults report as an experience of causation.
They they experience merely patterns of movement.
And, in this case, reversing on sequence should create no more interest than reversing the other.
But now suppose that infants do have something like what adults report as an experience 
of causation?
Then, when reversing the first sequence, there are two changes: there is a change both to the 
movement and to the character of the causal interaction.  To put it informally,
reversing direction means that the patient of the interaction becomes its agent.
So the hypothesis that infants' experiences of Michotte-like stimuli resemble adults 
predicts that there will be greater dishabituation when the first, `direct launching` sequence 
is reversed.

\citep[p.~ 30]{hubbard:2012_phenomenala}: ‘Belanger and Desrochers (2001) replicated findings of
Leslie and Keeble (1987) and others that 6-month old infants dishabituated more to reversal of a
launching effect stimulus than to reversal of a noncausal (spatial gap or temporal gap) stimulus.’

\citep[pp.~ 30--1]{hubbard:2012_phenomenala}:‘Schlottmann et al. (2012) habituated 4-, 5-, and
6-month old infants to displays of a (a) reaction effect stimulus or (b) reaction effect stimulus
with a temporal gap between the launcher and the target. ... The data were consistent with Leslie
and Keeble’s (1987) finding that 6-month old infants dishabituated more to a reversal of a launching
effect stimulus than to a reversal of a noncausal stimulus.’

        <div class="notes">This paradigm also works with chimps:
\citep[p.~505]{hubbard:2012_phenomenal}: ‘O’Connell and Dunbar (2005) adapted the habituation paradigm used with human infants (e.g., Leslie 1982; Leslie and Keeble 1987) and presented causal stimuli or noncausal stimuli to chimpanzees. Dishabituation was greater for chimpanzees habituated to a causal stimulus and presented with a noncausal stimulus than for chimpanzees habituated to a noncausal stimulus and presented with a causal stimulus, and this was interpreted as consistent with causal perception.’

<div class="notes">Perception involves a system (at least one) of indexes which attach to objects
These object indexes can be thought of, roughly, as mental analogues of the
pins that an old fashioned logistician sticks into a map in keeping track of
supply trucks.
When things go well, the movements of trucks on the ground are mirrored by
the movements of pins on the map.
The key characteristic of the pins is this: ignoring re-use, if you have
the same pin at two times, then the trucks it points to at those times are
one and the same truck.</div>

a system of object indexes has been challenged.  
See \citet[p.\ 59]{scholl:2009_what}:
\begin{quote}
`I suggest that what Pylyshyn’s (2004) experiments show is exactly what they intuitively 
seem to show: We can keep track of the targets in MOT, but not which one is which. 
[...]
all of this seems easily explained [...] by the view 
that MOT is simply realized by split object-based attention to the MOT targets as a set.'
\end{quote}
It is surely right that the existence of MOT does not, all by itself,
provide support for the existence of a system of object indexes.
However, contra what Scholl seems to be suggesting here, the MOT paradigm 
can be adapated to provide such evidence.
Thus, for instance, \citet{horowitz:2010_direction} show that, in a MOT paradigm, observers 
can report the direction of one or two targets without advance knowledge of which 
targets' directions they will be asked to report.)

Your task is to say whether this letter is one of the letters that appeared at the start or whether it is a new letter.

Of interest is how long this takes you to respond in two cases: when the letter appears on the same object at the start and end, and, in contrast, when the letter appears on one object at the start and a different object at the end.
It turns out that most people can answer the question more quickly in the first case.
That is, they are faster when a letter appears on the same object twice than when it appears on two different objects 
\citep{Kahneman:1992xt}.
This difference in response times is the

a patterned square disappears behind the barrier; later a plain black ring emerges.  
If you consider speed and direction only, these movements are consistent with there being just one object.
But given the distinct shapes and textures of these things, it seems all but certain that there must be two objects.
Yet in many cases these two objects will be assigned the same object index \citep{flombaum:2006_temporal,mitroff:2007_space}.
So one signature limit of systems of object indexes is that information about speed and distance can override information about shape and texture.

return to the old-fashioned logistician who is keeping track of supply trucks.
In doing this she has only quite limited information to go on.
She receives sporadic reports that a supply truck has been sighted at one or another location.
But these reports do not specify which supply truck is at that location.
She must therefore work out which pin to move to the newly reported location.
In doing this she might rely on assumptions about the trucks’ movements being constrained to trace continuous paths, and about the direction and speed of the trucks typically remaining constant.
These assumptions allow her to use the sporadic reports that some truck or other is there in forming views about the routes a particular truck has taken.
A system of object indexes faces the same problem when the indexed objects are not continuously perceptible.
What assumptions or principles are used to determine whether this object at time $t_1$ and that object at time $t_2$ have the same object index pinned to them?

        <div class="notes">Suppose object indexes are being used in tracking four or more objects simultaneously and one of these objects—call it the \emph{first object}—disappears behind a barrier.
Later two objects appear from behind the barrier, one on the far side of the barrier (call this the \emph{far object}) and one close to the point where the object disappeared (call this the \emph{near object}).
If the system of object indexes relies on assumptions about speed and direction of movement, then the first object and the far object should be assigned the same object index.
But this is not what typically happens.
Instead it is likely that the first object and the near object are assigned the same object index.%
\footnote{
See \citet{franconeri:2012_simple}.  Note that this corrects an earlier argument for a contrary view \citep{scholl:1999_tracking}.
}
If this were what always happened, then we could not fully explain how infants represent objects as persisting by appeal to object indexes because, at least in some cases, infants do use assumptions about speed and direction in interpolating the locations of briefly unperceived objects.
There would be a discrepancy between the Principles of Object Perception which characterise how infants represent objects as persisting and the principles that describe how object indexes work.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">But this is not the whole story about object indexes.
It turns out that object indexes behave differently when just one object is being tracked and the object-specific preview benefit is used to detect them.
In this case it seems that assumptions about continuity and constancy in speed and direction do play a role in determining whether an object at $t_1$ and an object at $t_2$ are assigned the same object indexes \citep{flombaum:2006_temporal,mitroff:2007_space}.
In the terms introduced in the previous paragraph, in this case where just one object is being tracked, the first object and the far object are assigned the same object index.
This suggests that the principles which govern object indexes may match the principles which characterise how infants represent objects as persisting.

          <p>The launching effect: detecting a 50ms difference in the delay between two movements.</p>
          <div class="notes">Part of the answer is this.  We don't worry about the content of the verbal reports.
We just focus on the fact that their content changes depending on a tiny, 50 millisecond

It's reasonably obvious that object indexes require segmentation (otherwise how would they
attach to *objects*), and the evidence that they can survive occlusion is relatively easy to
understand.  But the point that having object indexes involves tracking causal interactions
is less straightforward.  So let's consider that ...

        <div class="notes">Object indexes are linked to causation.
In order to track objects, a perceptual system has to be sensitive to be causal interactions
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Why is this true?
Because when you have a causal interaction, there's a conflict between principles of object 
perception e.g. distinct surfaces=>two objects, vs good continuity of motion=>one object
The perceptual system needs to know when conflicts should be reconciled and when they should 
be written off.
We get perceptual effects of causal interactions when there are conflicts among cues of object 
identity.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">This is a point Michotte made.  He found that launching occurs when there is a conflict between 
cues to object identity: good continuity of movement suggests a single object whereas the 
existence of two distinct surfaces indicates two objects.

        <div class="notes">It is plausible that other types of causal interaction also involve conflicts between cues 
to object identity.

sequences, features of the second object (such as motion) remain bound to the first object for

          <div class="notes">Schlottmann and Shanks (1992, Experiment 2) ... The point of this
experiment was to distinguish between cues to causality provided by
perceptual features within a display (launching vs. delay) and by
statistical contingencies (between Object A moving and Object B moving) as
observed across trials. If Michotte’s hypothesis is correct, statistical
contingencies should not affect perceptual judgments of whether a
launching has occurred. Conversely, perceptual features should not affect
judgments of whether A’s movement is statistically necessary for B’s
movement.  ... The results of the study were clear cut ...: Launching versus delay
affected ratings of how convincing the collisions looked but not ratings of
necessity. However, the presence of a predictive statistical relation
affected ratings of necessity but not ratings of convincingness. These
results are consistent with Michotte’s hypothesis: Statistical
contingencies over trials do not affect the cause detector on the right of
Figure 3A, which is sensitive only to purely spatio-temporal properties of
the individual displays.

But if we show subjects a sequence like the launching effect but where the first square 
overlaps the second's position before it moves.  When this event is shown is isolation 
almost all subjects see it as a single object changing colour.  But when the event is 
shown with an 
unambiguous launching effect nearby, almost all subjects now see the 'overlap' event as 
a launching.

            <div class="notes">‘This possibility, though, is not one that advocates of Michotte’s
hypothesis have taken up. The favored view is one in which separate
modules are responsible for descriptions of objects and of their
mechanical interactions, with central mechanisms then resolving potential
conflicts between them. 
For example, Leslie (1988) argues that perceptual
modules do not by themselves settle inconsistencies between the spatial
positions of objects and their causal interactions. In certain 
illusions, adults tend to perceive solid objects passing through each other
(Leslie cites the Pulfrich double-pendulum illusion; see Wilson &
Robinson, 1986). Thus, the module for object tracking doesn’t prohibit
interpretations of physical events that are causally impossible. Of
course, people realize that such events cannot really be taking place and
are surprised when they perceive them, but that is because they have
principles stored in long-term memory—for example, the principle that two
solid objects cannot be in the same place at the same time—that classify
these events as illusions or anomalies. Leslie’s argument suggests
that people individuate objects and calculate their causal relations by
means of separate mechanisms; thus, we can’t count on causal constraints
being part of the object-tracking module. If Leslie is right, there is
reason to question Butterfill’s (2009) conjecture that ‘object
perception and causal perception are one and the same process’’ (p.
421).’
            </div>
            <div class="notes">Response: it was too simple to say that 
‘object perception and causal perception are one and the same process’ or to
talk about ‘object perception and physical reasoning’ because object perception 
is a complicated thing with many aspects.
What Carey and Spelke (and following them, Butterfill) should have said is that
there is a system of object indexes which assigns indexes in ways that reflects
physical constraints such as solidity on objects’ motions, and this is what gives
rise to the launching effect.

Ingeniously, Michotte compares launching with the movement of a single object. The single 
object moves half way across a screen then pauses before continuing to move. Michotte found 
that the longest pause between the two movements consistent with subjects experiencing them 
as a single movement is around 80ms, exactly the longest pause consistent with experiences 
characteristic of launching \citep[pp.\ 91--8, 124]{Michotte:1946nz}. Accordingly, the 
experience characteristic of launching appears to require that the two movements be 
experienced as uninterrupted—--this is why they can be separated by a pause of up to but 
no longer than 80ms.

          <div class="notes">The perceptual system responsible for identifying objects must also concern itself with certain 
kinds of causal interaction in order to reconcile conflicting cues to object identity.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">In slightly more detail: one function of our perceptual systems is to identify and track 
objects; this is done by means of various cues; sometimes the visual system is faced with 
conflicting cues to object identity which need to be resolved in order to arrive at a 
satisfactory interpretation; when certain types of causal interaction occur there is a 
conflict among cues to object identity; these conflicts must be treated differently from other 
conflicts because they do not indicate failures of object identification and so do not  
require resolution or further perceptual processing. 
So object perception depends on sensitivity to certain types of causal interaction and this is 
why the launching effect occurs.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">This is unexpected insofar as perception is often supposed to be limited to features of the 
world less abstract that causal interactions.  Indeed, the notion that perceptual processes
represent three-dimensional objects rather than mere surfaces was at one time controversial.
The research we have reviewed shows that perceptual processes represent not only 
three-dimensional but properly physical objects, that is, objects capable of causally
interacting with each other.

acoustic stimuli on launching, suggesting that the effect may not be modality-specific
(The evidence on this point is controversial. Sekuler and colleagues show that when subjects observe
an ambiguous visual display consistent with either a collision or a passing event, the timing of a
tone can control whether subjects report seeing a collision or pass- ing, and argue that this is a
multisensory phenomenon: R. Sekuler et al., ‘Sound Alters Visual Motion Perception’, Nature, 
(), p. . Watanabe and Shimojo extend this finding by showing that not any event (or
non-event) which draws attention at the moment of a collision will disambiguate the display; they
argue that the tone’s effect on the perception of a col- lision is a ‘genuine audiovisual effect,
not an audiovisual effect that results from auditory effects’: K. Watanabe and S. Shimojo, ‘When
Sound Affects Vision: Effects of Auditory Grouping on Visual Motion Perception’, Psychological
Science,  (), pp. –. Guski and Troje, on the other hand, show that features which carry
no information about causation, such as a blink, can also influence whether subjects report seeing a
collision or a passing. These authors conclude that auditory influences on the perceptual of
collisions are ‘no true cross-modal phenomenon’: R. Guski and N.F. Troje, ‘Audiovisual Phenomenal
Causality’, Perception and Psychophysics,  (), pp. –, at p. .)

this situation, perceivers’ verbal reports imply the objects’ paths crossed
whereas measuring an object-specific preview benefit implies that the objects
bounced off each other. The object indexes underpinning object-specific
preview benefits are unlikely to be informing phenomenal expectations about
objects’ movements in this situation. Object indexes and phenomenal
expectations can come apart in some situations.

          <div class="notes">Leslie’s informal report on the Pulfrich double pendulum illusion (which
appears never to have been published) suffices to show that 
it was too simple to say that 
‘object perception and causal perception are one and the same process’ or to
talk about ‘object perception and physical reasoning’.
But it remains possible that the launching effects are consequences of the 
ways that object indexes are assigned and maintained (although this is far 
from the only conclusion compatible with the limited available evidence).
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Rips: ‘This possibility, though, is not one that advocates of Michotte’s
hypothesis have taken up. The favored view is one in which separate
modules are responsible for descriptions of objects and of their
mechanical interactions, with central mechanisms then resolving potential
conflicts between them. 
For example, Leslie (1988) argues that perceptual
modules do not by themselves settle inconsistencies between the spatial
positions of objects and their causal interactions. In certain 
illusions, adults tend to perceive solid objects passing through each other
(Leslie cites the Pulfrich double-pendulum illusion; see Wilson &
Robinson, 1986). Thus, the module for object tracking doesn’t prohibit
interpretations of physical events that are causally impossible. Of
course, people realize that such events cannot really be taking place and
are surprised when they perceive them, but that is because they have
principles stored in long-term memory—for example, the principle that two
solid objects cannot be in the same place at the same time—that classify
these events as illusions or anomalies. Leslie’s argument suggests
that people individuate objects and calculate their causal relations by
means of separate mechanisms; thus, we can’t count on causal constraints
being part of the object-tracking module. If Leslie is right, there is
reason to question Butterfill’s (2009) conjecture that ‘object
perception and causal perception are one and the same process’’ (p.
421).’

        <div class="notes">The primary functions of object indexes include influencing the allocation
of attention and perhaps guiding ongoing action.
If this is right, it may be possible to explain anticipatory looking 
directly by appeal to the operations of  object indexes.
But the operations of object indexes cannot directly explain differences 
in how novel things are to an infant.
And nor can the operations of object indexes directly explain why infants
look longer at stimuli involving discrepancies in the physical behaviour
of objects.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">To illustrate this point, recall this famous habituation experiment ....
        </div>
        <div class="notes">We know that infants are likely to maintain object indexes for the object
while it is occluded.
Accordingly, when the screen drops in the condition labelled 
‘impossible outcome’, there is an interruption to the normal 
operation of object indexes: infants have assigned two object indexes 
but there is only one object.
But why does this cause infants to look longer at in the
‘impossible outcome’ condition than in the ‘possible outcome’ condition?
How does a difference in operations involving object indexes result
in a difference in looking times?
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Claim (supported by the developmental discrepancy): the phenomenology
associated with the launching effect is rich enough to support habituation
effects but not manual search.
Consequence: the experience is probably not an experience of causal interaction.

          </div>
          <div class="notes">Here is a wire.
Contrast two sensory encounters with this wire. In the first you visually 
experience the wire as having a certain shape. In the second you receive an 
electric shock from the wire without seeing or touching it.%
\footnote{This illustration is borrowed from Campbell (2002: 133–4); I use it to support a claim weaker than his.}
The first sensory encounter involves perceptual experience as of a property of
the wire whereas, intuitively, the second does not. 
I take this intuition to be correct.%
\footnote{
Notice that the intuition is not that the shock involves no 
perceptual experience at all, only that the shock does not involve 
perceptual experience as of any property of the wire. Notice also that the 
intuition concerns what a perceptual experience is as of, and not directly 
what is represented in perception. The relation between these two is 
arguably not straightforward (compare, e.g., \citet[p.~28]{Shoemaker:1994el} or 
\citet[pp.~50--2]{Chalmers:2006xq} on distinguishing representational from 
phenomenal content).
}
          </div>
          <div class="notes">The intuition is potentially revealing because the electric shock involves 
rich phenomenology, and its particular phenomenal character depends in part 
on properties of its cause (changes in the strength of the electric current 
would have resulted in an encounter with different phenomenal character). 
So there are sensory encounters which, despite having phenomenal characters 
that depend in part on which properties are encountered, are not perceptual 
experiences as of those properties.

When you see this face, you have a feeling of familiarity.
This feeling of familiarity is not just a matter of belief:
even if you know for sure that you have never encountered the person

will persist.

          <div class="notes">(The face is a composite of Bush and Obama.  It is chosen to illustrate that
the feeling of familiarity is not a consequence of how familiar things 
actually are; instead it may be a consequnece of 
the degree of fluency with which unconscious processes can identify 
perceived items \citep{Whittlesea:1993xk,Whittlesea:1998qj}.
Learning a grammar can also generate feelings of familiarity.
Subjects who have implicitly learned an artificial grammar report feelings 
of familiarity when they encounter novel stimuli that are part of 
the learnt grammar \citep{scott:2008_familiarity}.
They are also not doomed to treat feelings of familiarity as being
about actual familiarity:
instead subjects can use feeling of 
familiarity in deciding whether a stimulus is from that grammar 
\citep{Wan:2008_familiarity}.)

Even if you don’t believe that there are sensations in Reid’s sense,
thinking of phenomenal expectations as if they were sensations will

The main points that follow are consistent with several different ways of
thinking about phenomenal expectations.
For instance, you might take the view that 
what I am calling phenomenal expectations are
perceptual experiences of the body or of bodily reactions,
or that they involve some kind of cognitive phenomenology.
The essential claim is just that the phenomenal expectations associated with
the operations of object indexes are not constituted by states which involve
intentional relations to any of the things which are assigned an object index.

(\citealp[Essay~II, Chap.~16, p.~228]{Reid:1785cj}
\citealp[Chap.~VI sect.~III, pp.~164–5]{Reid:1785nz}).
Let me explain.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">As a scientist, you can pick out the feeling of familiarity as that
phenomenal expectation which is normally caused by the degree to which
certain processes are fluent.
But as the subject of who has that phenomenal expectation, you do not 
necessarily know what its typical causes are.
This is something you have to work out in whatever ways you work out
the causes of any other type of event.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">(Contrast phenomenal expectations with perceptual experiences.
Having 
a perceptual experience of, say, a wire’s shape, involves standing
in an intentional relation to the wire’s shape; and the phenomenal
character of this perceptual experience is specified by this 
intentional relation.%
\footnote{
Compare \citet[p.~380]{Martin:2002yx}:
‘I attend to what it is like for me to inspect the lavender bush through 
perceptually attending to the bush itself.’ 
And \citet[p.~211]{byrne:2001_intentionalism}
‘subject can only discover the phenomenal character of her experience by 
attending to the world ... as her experience represents it.’
}
Such perceptual experiences are often held to reveal the wire’s shape to the 
subject and so lead directly to beliefs.%
\footnote{
Compare \citet[p.~222]{Johnston:1992zb}:
‘[j]ustified belief … is available simply on the basis of visual perception’;
\citet[p.~143–4]{Tye:1995oa}:
‘Phenomenal character “stands ready … to make a direct impact on beliefs’;
and
\citet[p.~291]{Smith:2001iz}:
‘[p]erceptual experiences are … intrinsically … belief-inducing.’
})
            </div>
            <div class="notes">(By contrast, having a phenomenal expectation concerning familiarity or an
physical object’s path does not involve standing in any intentional relation
to these things.
The phenomenal expectation is individuated by its normal causes, rather 
than by any intentional relation.
And a phenomenal expectation leads to belief, if at all, only indirectly.
For learning is required in order for the subject to come to a view on
what tends to cause the phenomenal expectation.)
            </div>
            <div class="notes">Phenomenal expectations have been quite widely neglected in philosophy and
developmental psychology.
They are a means by which cognitive processes enable perceivers to 
acquire dispositions to form beliefs about objects’ properties which are 
reliably true.    
Phenomenal expectations provide a low-cost but efficient bridge between 
non-conscious cognitive processes and conscious reasoning.
