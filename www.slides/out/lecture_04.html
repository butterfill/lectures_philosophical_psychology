        <div class="notes handout">Infants at around six months of age seem also to distinguish launching from other sequences, 
much as adults do \citep{Leslie:1987nr}.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">[nb: Several people have discussed this in seminars so I won't discuss it here (the reference is on your handout).]
        </div>
        <div class="notes">In their experiment, they compared two groups of infants.
The first group was habituated to the top display, which is just the sort of animation Michotte
used to get reports of causal experiences in adults.
After habituation, this first group was then shown the same display except that the direction was 
reversed.
Meanwhile a second group was habituated to a display like the top display here except 
that there was a delay between the first object stopping and the second object starting.
This delay would mean that, in adults, there are no reports of experiences of a causal interaction.
After habituation, this second group was shown the same display except that the direction of 
movement was reversed.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Of interest was whether the first group showed greater dishabituation to the reversal than 
the second group.
How could this tell us anything about infants' experiences?
Suppose that infants do not have anything like what adults report as an experience of causation.
They they experience merely patterns of movement.
And, in this case, reversing on sequence should create no more interest than reversing the other.
But now suppose that infants do have something like what adults report as an experience 
of causation?
Then, when reversing the first sequence, there are two changes: there is a change both to the 
movement and to the character of the causal interaction.  To put it informally,
reversing direction means that the patient of the interaction becomes its agent.
So the hypothesis that infants' experiences of Michotte-like stimuli resemble adults 
predicts that there will be greater dishabituation when the first, `direct launching` sequence 
is reversed.

These object indexes can be thought of, roughly, as mental analogues of the
pins that an old fashioned logistician sticks into a map in keeping track of
supply trucks.
When things go well, the movements of trucks on the ground are mirrored by
the movements of pins on the map.
The key characteristic of the pins is this: ignoring re-use, if you have
the same pin at two times, then the trucks it points to at those times are
one and the same truck.</div>

a system of object indexes has been challenged.  
See \citet[p.\ 59]{scholl:2009_what}:
\begin{quote}
`I suggest that what Pylyshyn’s (2004) experiments show is exactly what they intuitively 
seem to show: We can keep track of the targets in MOT, but not which one is which. 
[...]
all of this seems easily explained [...] by the view 
that MOT is simply realized by split object-based attention to the MOT targets as a set.'
\end{quote}
It is surely right that the existence of MOT does not, all by itself,
provide support for the existence of a system of object indexes.
However, contra what Scholl seems to be suggesting here, the MOT paradigm 
can be adapated to provide such evidence.
Thus, for instance, \citet{horowitz:2010_direction} show that, in a MOT paradigm, observers 
can report the direction of one or two targets without advance knowledge of which 
targets' directions they will be asked to report.)

Your task is to say whether this letter is one of the letters that appeared at the start or whether it is a new letter.
Consider just those cases in which the answer is yes: the letter at the end is one of those which you saw at the start.
Of interest is how long this takes you to respond in two cases: when the letter appears on the same object at the start and end, and, in contrast, when the letter appears on one object at the start and a different object at the end.
It turns out that most people can answer the question more quickly in the first case.
That is, they are faster when a letter appears on the same object twice than when it appears on two different objects 
\citep{Kahneman:1992xt}.
This difference in response times is the

\emph{object-specific preview benefit}.
Its existence shows that, in this task, you are keeping track of which object is which as they move.
This is why the existence of an object-specific preview benefit is taken to be evidence that object indexes exist.

If you consider speed and direction only, these movements are consistent with there being just one object.
But given the distinct shapes and textures of these things, it seems all but certain that there must be two objects.
Yet in many cases these two objects will be assigned the same object index \citep{flombaum:2006_temporal,mitroff:2007_space}.
So one signature limit of systems of object indexes is that information about speed and distance can override information about shape and texture.

return to the old-fashioned logistician who is keeping track of supply trucks.
In doing this she has only quite limited information to go on.
She receives sporadic reports that a supply truck has been sighted at one or another location.
But these reports do not specify which supply truck is at that location.
She must therefore work out which pin to move to the newly reported location.
In doing this she might rely on assumptions about the trucks’ movements being constrained to trace continuous paths, and about the direction and speed of the trucks typically remaining constant.
These assumptions allow her to use the sporadic reports that some truck or other is there in forming views about the routes a particular truck has taken.
A system of object indexes faces the same problem when the indexed objects are not continuously perceptible.
What assumptions or principles are used to determine whether this object at time $t_1$ and that object at time $t_2$ have the same object index pinned to them?

continuity of motion is important for assigning and maintaining object indexes.]
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Suppose object indexes are being used in tracking four or more objects simultaneously and one of these objects—call it the \emph{first object}—disappears behind a barrier.
Later two objects appear from behind the barrier, one on the far side of the barrier (call this the \emph{far object}) and one close to the point where the object disappeared (call this the \emph{near object}).
If the system of object indexes relies on assumptions about speed and direction of movement, then the first object and the far object should be assigned the same object index.
But this is not what typically happens.
Instead it is likely that the first object and the near object are assigned the same object index.%
\footnote{
See \citet{franconeri:2012_simple}.  Note that this corrects an earlier argument for a contrary view \citep{scholl:1999_tracking}.
}
If this were what always happened, then we could not fully explain how infants represent objects as persisting by appeal to object indexes because, at least in some cases, infants do use assumptions about speed and direction in interpolating the locations of briefly unperceived objects.
There would be a discrepancy between the Principles of Object Perception which characterise how infants represent objects as persisting and the principles that describe how object indexes work.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">But this is not the whole story about object indexes.
It turns out that object indexes behave differently when just one object is being tracked and the object-specific preview benefit is used to detect them.
In this case it seems that assumptions about continuity and constancy in speed and direction do play a role in determining whether an object at $t_1$ and an object at $t_2$ are assigned the same object indexes \citep{flombaum:2006_temporal,mitroff:2007_space}.
In the terms introduced in the previous paragraph, in this case where just one object is being tracked, the first object and the far object are assigned the same object index.
This suggests that the principles which govern object indexes may match the principles which characterise how infants represent objects as persisting.

          <div class="notes">Part of the answer is this.  We don't worry about the content of the verbal reports.

It's reasonably obvious that object indexes require segmentation (otherwise how would they
attach to *objects*), and the evidence that they can survive occlusion is relatively easy to
understand.  But the point that having object indexes involves tracking causal interactions
is less straightforward.  So let's consider that ...

In order to track objects, a perceptual system has to be sensitive to be causal interactions
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Why is this true?
Because when you have a causal interaction, there's a conflict between principles of object 
perception e.g. distinct surfaces=>two objects, vs good continuity of motion=>one object
The perceptual system needs to know when conflicts should be reconciled and when they should 
be written off.
We get perceptual effects of causal interactions when there are conflicts among cues of object 
identity.

        <div class="notes">This is a point Michotte made.  He found that launching occurs when there is a conflict between 
cues to object identity: good continuity of movement suggests a single object whereas the 
existence of two distinct surfaces indicates two objects.

As I said,
normally, if the two balls overlap completely, subjects report seeing a single object 
changing colour.
But if we show subjects a sequence like the launching effect but where the first square 
overlaps the second's position before it moves.  When this event is shown is isolation 
almost all subjects see it as a single object changing colour.  But when the event is 
shown with an 
unambiguous launching effect nearby, almost all subjects now see the 'overlap' event as 
a launching.
Causal capture means that we can show subjects a sequence with complete overlap and 
still have the report a causal effect.

‘a simple categorical explanation for the Causal Crescents illusion: the visual system, 
when led by other means to perceive an event as a causal collision, effectively 
‘refuses’ to see the two objects as fully overlapped, because of an internalized 
constraint to the effect that such a spatial arrangement is not physically possible. 
As a result, a thin crescent of one object remains uncovered by the other one-as 
would in fact be the case in a straight-on billiard-ball collision where the motion 
occurs at an angle close to the line of sight.’

Contrast Spelke’s view.
‘objects are conceived: Humans come to know about an object’s unity, boundaries, and 
persistence in ways like those by which we come to know about its material composition 
or its market value.’

Is what people detect when the launching effect occurs a causal interaction?
You might say, it can't be a causal interaction

              <div class="notes">How is this consistent with the laws of mechanics—surely no pause can be tolerated? 
Ingeniously, Michotte compares launching with the movement of a single object. The single 
object moves half way across a screen then pauses before continuing to move. Michotte found 
that the longest pause between the two movements consistent with subjects experiencing them 
as a single movement is around 80ms, exactly the longest pause consistent with experiences 
characteristic of launching \citep[pp.\ 91--8, 124]{Michotte:1946nz}. Accordingly, the 
experience characteristic of launching appears to require that the two movements be 
experienced as uninterrupted—--this is why they can be separated by a pause of up to but 
no longer than 80ms.

          <div class="notes">A question was:</div>

          <div class="notes">Now I think we have achieved an answer:
          </div>
          <p class="em-above notes show">Causal interactions are detected by the perceptual processes involved in segmenting
and tracking objects.
          </p>
          <div class="notes">The perceptual system responsible for identifying objects must also concern itself with certain 
kinds of causal interaction in order to reconcile conflicting cues to object identity.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">In slightly more detail: one function of our perceptual systems is to identify and track 
objects; this is done by means of various cues; sometimes the visual system is faced with 
conflicting cues to object identity which need to be resolved in order to arrive at a 
satisfactory interpretation; when certain types of causal interaction occur there is a 
conflict among cues to object identity; these conflicts must be treated differently from other 
conflicts because they do not indicate failures of object identification and so do not  
require resolution or further perceptual processing. 
So object perception depends on sensitivity to certain types of causal interaction and this is 
why the launching effect occurs.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">This is unexpected insofar as perception is often supposed to be limited to features of the 
world less abstract that causal interactions.  Indeed, the notion that perceptual processes
represent three-dimensional objects rather than mere surfaces was at one time controversial.
The research we have reviewed shows that perceptual processes represent not only 
three-dimensional but properly physical objects, that is, objects capable of causally
interacting with each other.
