  <div class="notes">‘On the Developmental Origins of Knowledge of Physical Objects’
  </div>
  <div class="notes">Cognitive development---the fact
that humans typically begin life with quite
limited cognitive abilities and gradually acquire more---raises some fundamentally 
philosophical challenges.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">Despite this, cognitive development has been quite
widely ignored by contemporary philosophers of mind. 
But it wasn’t always like this ...

            <div class="notes">Where Locke asked a question about Ideas, I want to consider a perhaps
simpler question about knowledge. How do humans make the transition from
not knowing any simple facts about particular things in a given domain 
to possessing some such knowledge?
            </div>
            <div class="notes">Research on this question in developmental psychology motivates a further question.
How can we understand partially formed minds and the actions they give
rise to? What representations and processes are needed to expalin these
actions? (Special kind of knowledge, like ‘core knowledge’?)

And, second, How do you get from these early forms of cognition to 
knowledge of simple facts about particular physical objects?

<div class="notes">Evidence that four- and five-month-olds can track momentarily occluded objects comes from studies
using habituation, violation-of-expectations, anticipatory looking and the completion of an action
directed to a fully occluded object that was prepared in advance of the object being fully
occluded.</div>

a display containing one object, or else a display containing two objects,
and the question was whether they would prefer to look at one object or at two.

          <div class="notes">There is a wide range of evidence that four- and five-month-olds can track 
briefly occluded objects.
Such evidence comes from infants’ reactions to a range of different scenarios. 
Some scenrios involve a comparision between the number of objects 
\citep[e.g.][]{spelke:1995_spatiotemporal},
others involve infants’ abilities to track the causal effects of 
unperceived objects
\citep[e.g][]{baillargeon:1987_object}, 
while others require infants to track properties such as the shape and 
size of unperceived objects
\citep[e.g.][]{wang:2004_young},
or to remember the location of a hidden object \citep[e.g.][]{wilcox:1996_location}.

            <div class="notes">For a process to \emph{track} the path of an occluded object 
is for it to nonaccidentally  depend in some way on  
the occluded object’s path: in an interesting but limited range of 
situations, changes to the object’s path will cause corresponding 
changes to how the process unfolds.
Relatedly, to say that someone can track occluded objects
is to say that there are processes in her (or otherwise appropriately 
involving her) 
which track the paths of some occluded objects.

            <div class="notes">How do infants track briefly occluded objects?
An early idea was that infants’ earliest abilities involved
knowledge of physical objects.  On this view, infants know simple principles
governing how objects behave (for example, that they follow continuous paths through
space and time) and infants know the locations of some briefly occluded objects.
In an early paper Spelke offered a strong statement of this view.

infants know the facts about the locations of briefly occluded objects ...

              <div class="notes">To illustrate, consider an ingenious experiment by \citet{Shinskey:2001fk}.
There was an opaque screen that could rotate between lying flat on the ground and being raised to conceal a toy behind it.
\citeauthor{Shinskey:2001fk} also used a second piece of apparatus just like the first except that the screen was transparent rather than opaque.
They reasoned that infants would quite often pull the screen forwards just for fun, regardless of what is behind it.
However, they also guessed that when infants know there is an interesting toy behind the screen, then they will pull it forwards more often than when they know that there is nothing behind the screen.
This is just what happened when infants were presented with the apparatus involving a transparent screen:
they sometimes pulled the screen forwards when there was no toy behind it, but they pulled it forwards significantly more often when the toy was behind it.
What happened  when infants were presented with the opaque screen?
Here infants pulled the screen forwards no more often when they had observed a toy being placed behind it then when they had observed that there was nothing behind it.
This is evidence that  seven-month-old infants do not know that a toy they have very recently seen hidden behind a screen is behind the screen.
After all, since knowledge guides action we would expect infants who know that a toy is behind an opaque screen to pull the screen forward more often than infants who know there is nothing behind the screen, just as they do when the screen is transparent.
              </div>
              <div class="notes">More than two decades of research strongly supports the view that 
infants fail to search for objects hidden behind barriers or screens 
until around eight months of age \citep[p.\ 202]{Meltzoff:1998wp} or 
maybe even later \citep{moore:2008_factors}.
Researchers have carefully controlled for the possibility that infants’
failures to search are due to extraneous demands on memory or the 
control of action.
We must therefore conclude, I think, that four- and five-month-old 
infants do not have beliefs about the locations of briefly occluded 
objects.  
It is the absence of belief that explains their failures to search.

              </div>
              <div class="notes">We are interested in whether infants were more likely to pull the screen forwards when the 
object was present than when it was absent.
Since infants wanted the toy, if they knew it was behind the barrier they should have pulled
forward the barrier more often when the toy was behind it.
This is exactly what they did when the barrier was transparent.
But look what happens when the barrier is opaque, so that the toy is not visible to infants 
when they have to prepare the pulling action: they no longer pull the barrier more often
when the toy was behind it.
              </div>
              <div class="notes">This is good evidence that 7 month olds do not know facts about the locations of objects 
they cannot perceive.
And this is not isolated evidence; for example, \citet{moore:2008_factors} use a different 
methods also involving manual search to provide converging evidence for this conclusion. 
But now we have a problem ...

              <div class="notes">But what happens if instead of measuring reaching we measure looking times?
\citet{charles:2009_object} compared what happens when an object is momentarily hidden behind a screen with what happens when an object is momentarily  hidden by darkness.
They used a trick with light and mirrors so that for some of the infants, the object did not reappear when the screen came up or the light returned.
Surprisingly, five-month-old infants’ looking times indicated that an expectation had been violated only when the object was hidden behind a screen but not when hidden by darkness.

              <div class="notes">So five-month-olds not only sometimes fail to search for hidden objects but 
also sometimes fail to look longer when a momentarily hidden object fails

              <div class="notes">I think this pattern of findings is good evidence against the hypothesis
that four- or five-month-olds have beliefs about, or knowledege of,
the locations of 
unperceived objects.
After all, 
a belief is essentially the kind of state that can inform actions of any
kind, whether they involve looking, searching with the hands or anything
else.

          <div class="notes">So talk of core knowledge is somehow supposed to latch onto the idea of a system.
What do these authors mean by talking about 'specialized perceptual systems'?
They talk about things like perceiving colour, depth or melodies.
Now, as we saw when talking about categorical perception of colour, we can think of the 'system' underlying categorical perception as largely separate from other cognitive systems--- we saw that they could be knocked out by verbal interference, for example.
So the idea is that core knowledge somehow involves a system that is separable from other cognitive mechanisms.
As Carey rather grandly puts it, understanding core knowledge will involve understanding something about 'the architecture of the mind'.

  <div class="notes">Let me illustrate limited accessibility ...
  </div>
  <div class="notes">Limited accessibility is a familiar feature of many cognitive systems.
When you grasp an object with a precision grip, it turns out that there is a very 
reliable pattern.
At a certain point in moving towards it your fingers will reach a maximum grip aperture 
which is normally a certain amount wider than the object to be grasped, and then start to close.
Now there's no physiological reason why grasping should work like this, rather than grip hand 
closing only once you contact the object.
Maximum grip aperture shows anticipation of the object: the mechanism responsible for 
guiding your action does so by representing various things including some features of 
the object.
But we ordinarily have no idea about this.
The discovery of how grasping is controlled depended on high speed photography.
This is an illustration of limited accessibility.
(This can also illustrate information encapsulation and domain specificity.)

Formally, an object index is ‘a mental token that functions as a

If you imagine using your fingers to track moving objects,
an object index is the mental counterpart of a finger \citep[p.~68]{pylyshyn:1989_role}.

        <div class="notes">The interesting thing about object indexes is that a system of object
indexes (at least one, maybe more)
appears to underpin cognitive processes which are not
strictly perceptual but also do not involve beliefs or knowledge states.
While I can’t fully explain the evidence for this claim here,
I do want to mention the two basic experimental tools that are used to
investigate the existence of, and the principles underpinning, 
a system of object indexes which operates 
between perception and thought ...

        <div class="notes">There is a behavioural marker of object-indexes called the object-specific preview benefit.
Suppose that you are shown an array of two objects, as depicted here.
At the start a letter appears briefly on each object.
(It is not important that letters are used; in theory, any readily 
distinguishable features should work.)

          <div class="notes">At the end of the task, a letter appears on one of the objects.
Your task is to say whether this letter is one of the letters that appeared at the start or whether it is a new letter.
Consider just those cases in which the answer is yes: the letter at the end is one of those which you saw at the start.
Of interest is how long this takes you to respond in two cases: when the letter appears on the same object at the start and end, and, in contrast, when the letter appears on one object at the start and a different object at the end.
It turns out that most people can answer the question more quickly in the first case.
That is, they are faster when a letter appears on the same object twice than when it appears on two different objects 
\citep{Kahneman:1992xt}.
This difference in response times is the 
% $glossary: object-specific preview benefit
\emph{object-specific preview benefit}.
Its existence shows that, in this task, you are keeping track of which object is which as they move.
This is why the existence of an object-specific preview benefit is taken to be evidence that object indexes exist.

In general, a \emph{signature limit of a system} is a pattern of behaviour the system exhibits which is both defective given what the system is for and peculiar to that system.

            <div class="notes">One signature limit of a system of object indexes is that featural information sometimes fails to influence how objects are assigned in ways that seem quite dramatic.
Let me illustrate ...

            <div class="notes">In this scenario, 
a patterned square disappears behind the barrier; later a plain black ring emerges.  
If you consider speed and direction only, these movements are consistent with there being just one object.
But given the distinct shapes and textures of these things, it seems all but certain that there must be two objects.
Yet in many cases these two objects will be assigned the same object index \citep{flombaum:2006_temporal,mitroff:2007_space}.
So one signature limit of systems of object indexes is that information about speed and distance can override information about shape and texture.

I should say that whereas I’m talking about object indexes,

ignore featural information in tracking occluded objects
\citep{xu:1996_infants}.%
\footnote{
This argument is complicated by evidence that infants around 10 months of age do not always fail to use featural information appropriately in representing objects as persisting \citep{wilcox:2002_infants}.
In fact \citet{mccurry:2009_beyond} report evidence that even five-month-olds can make use of featural information in representing objects as persisting \citep[see also][]{wilcox:1999_object}.
%they use a fringe and a reaching paradigm.  NB the reaching is a problem for the simple interpretation of looking vs reaching!
Likewise, object indexes are not always updated in ways that amount to ignoring featural information \citep{hollingworth:2009_object,moore:2010_features}.
It remains to be seen whether there is really an exact match between the signature limit on object indexes and the signature limit on four-month-olds’ abilities to represent objects as persisting.
The hypothesis under consideration---that infants’ abilities 
to track briefly occluded objects depend on a system of 
object indexes like that which underpins multiple object tracking or 
object-specific preview benefits---is a bet on the match being exact.

The central column shows that infants looked longer when they saw
two objects at test rather than when they saw a single object.
This is not different from how they performed in a base line condition
when the information about number was not present.
And it is different from how they performed in the ‘spatiotemporal
condition’ in which the two objects were at simultaneously

            <div class="notes">The hypothesis has an advantage which I don’t think is widely
recognised.
This is that object indexes are independent of beliefs and knowledge
states.
Having an object index pointing to a location is not the same thing
as believing that an object is there.
And nor is having an object index pointing to a series of locations over time
is the same thing as believing or knowing that these locations
are points on the path of a single object.
Further, the assignments of object indexes do not invariably give rise
to beliefs and need not match your beliefs.

sense: the world cannot be such that both are correct.

            <div class="notes">To illustrate, consider an ingenious experiment by \citet{Shinskey:2001fk}.
There was an opaque screen that could rotate between lying flat on the ground and being raised to conceal a toy behind it.
\citeauthor{Shinskey:2001fk} also used a second piece of apparatus just like the first except that the screen was transparent rather than opaque.
They reasoned that infants would quite often pull the screen forwards just for fun, regardless of what is behind it.
However, they also guessed that when infants know there is an interesting toy behind the screen, then they will pull it forwards more often than when they know that there is nothing behind the screen.
This is just what happened when infants were presented with the apparatus involving a transparent screen:
they sometimes pulled the screen forwards when there was no toy behind it, but they pulled it forwards significantly more often when the toy was behind it.
What happened  when infants were presented with the opaque screen?
Here infants pulled the screen forwards no more often when they had observed a toy being placed behind it then when they had observed that there was nothing behind it.
This is evidence that  seven-month-old infants do not know that a toy they have very recently seen hidden behind a screen is behind the screen.
After all, since knowledge guides action we would expect infants who know that a toy is behind an opaque screen to pull the screen forward more often than infants who know there is nothing behind the screen, just as they do when the screen is transparent.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">More than two decades of research strongly supports the view that 
infants fail to search for objects hidden behind barriers or screens 
until around eight months of age \citep[p.\ 202]{Meltzoff:1998wp} or 
maybe even later \citep{moore:2008_factors}.
Researchers have carefully controlled for the possibility that infants’
failures to search are due to extraneous demands on memory or the 
control of action.
We must therefore conclude, I think, that four- and five-month-old 
infants do not have beliefs about the locations of briefly occluded 
objects.  
It is the absence of belief that explains their failures to search.

This finding seems to run directly against the CLSTX conjecture.
After all, (1) object indexes do not survive endarkening; and 
(2) even if they did, they don’t enable you to initiate purposive actions.
So the CLSTX conjecture provides two independent reasons to predict 
that 5-month-olds will \textbf{not} search for endarkened objects.

Instead the occluder is a fringed screen through which you can reach.

        <div class="notes">Here's the authors' description of their procedure.
'Once the ball came to rest at the right edge of the platform, the platform was pushed forward
until the edge of the platform was directly in front of, and within easy reach of, the infant. In
the second phase, the infant was allowed to search for 20 s. ' \citep{mccurry:2009_beyond}
        </div>
        <div class="notes">McCurry et al found that 5 month old infants reach towards the cloth screen more often
when a cube goes in and a ball comes out than when a cube goes in and a cube comes
out. (I.e. cube-ball vs cube-cube.)
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Why?  On the CLSTX conjecture, this makes no sense.
As we saw, a signature limit of object indexes is their disregard for featural
information.  Further, object indexes don’t enable you to initate purposive actions.
So the CLSTX conjecture provides two reasons for making the incorrect prediction
that infants will not search longer in the cube-ball condition than in the ball-ball
condition.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">But if you think about it in terms of motor representations, it makes perfect sense.
Here is an occluder that is no barrier for action, so no obstacle to representing 
the objects motorically.
And of course motor processes care deeply about the shapes of things, so we should
expect a difference between the ball and the cube.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">McCurry et al designed the perfect experiment to show that the CLSTX conjecture is not
the whole story, and that 5-month-olds can represent unperceived objects motorically.
But I don’t want to make too much of this because I’m interpreting their findings post
hoc. 
Unfortunately this is not at all how they interpret their work.
Instead, they write that ‘when task demands are minimal (successful performance
requires only a direct reach through the fringe) young infants search reliably for
hidden objects.’
But I don’t think anyone who has carefully considered Shinskey and Munakata’s work
could be convinced by this idea.
It’s a shame they weren’t thinking in terms of the Crude Picture of the Mind,
but, you know, tant pis.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">[skip]
What should we predict?
Cloth screen does not prevent action,\footnote{
‘In the first familiarization trial, infants were shown the fringed-screen and were encouraged to
reach through the fringe. If necessary, the experimenter gently guided the infant’s hand through
the fringed-screen. Once the infant placed his or her hand through the fringed-screen twice, the
trial ended.’
}
so reaching should be possible.
Further, if motor representations are responsible for the effect, the fact that
the experiment requires sensitivity to featural information should not be an issue.
(Further, a version of this task using violation of expectations may fail 
because featural information is critical.)
And although these are very far from the terms in which they interpret their findings,
this is exactly what McCurry et al 2009 found.

          <div class="notes">The primary functions of object indexes include influencing the allocation
of attention and perhaps guiding ongoing action.
If this is right, it may be possible to explain anticipatory looking 
directly by appeal to the operations of  object indexes.
But the operations of object indexes cannot directly explain differences 
in how novel things are to an infant.
And nor can the operations of object indexes directly explain why infants
look longer at stimuli involving discrepancies in the physical behaviour
of objects.

        <div class="notes">We know that infants are likely to maintain object indexes for the two
mice while they are occluded.
Accordingly, when the screen drops in the condition labelled 
‘impossible outcome’, there is an interruption to the normal 
operation of object indexes: infants have assigned two object indexes 
but there is only one object.
But why does this cause infants to look longer at in the
‘impossible outcome’ condition than in the ‘possible outcome’ condition?
How does a difference in operations involving object indexes result
in a difference in looking times?
