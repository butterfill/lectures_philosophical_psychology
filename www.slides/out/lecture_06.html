Consider individual action.  Bratman has good arguments for holding that actions can
be intentional under a description even when no intention specifies that description;
and he also holds that agents incapable of intending may nevertheless perform intentional
actions.
So it is conceivable that not all intentional joint action will involve intention.

joint action.</div><div class="notes">I’m not going to pursue these issues yet, but we will come back to them.

Then you still intend that we go to New York together, but in a way that doesn't

The Simple View is an obstacle to discussing these theories.
If the Simple View is correct, none of the complexity philosophers have offered is needed.</div><div class="notes">The first problem I encounter in thinking about shared agency is that philosophers
seem to take for granted without argument that the Simple View can be excluded.
In fact it is surprisingly difficult to show that the Simple View is wrong.
The usual argument against it is that it is circular, but we saw that this argument 
depends on the mistaken assumption that all cases of acting together involve joint action.</div><div class="notes">A better objection to the Simple View involves counterexamples.
But we saw that the standard counterexample, Bratman’s mafia cases, does not work.
However refining that counterexample does appear to present a problem for the 
Simple View.</div><div class="notes">Note that I don’t claim that the objection to the Simple View is decisive;
in fact one of my aims in these lectures is to show that it is possible to
save the Simple View.

On the distributive reading they were soaked at least as many times as there are actions.
On the collective reading they were not necessarily soaked more than once.

On the distributive reading, each of their actions was directed to an outcome,

On the collective reading, by contrast, it is not necessary that any of the actions

For an intention identifies an outcome, coordinates some of the agent’s actions around that outcome, and coordinates them in such a way that, normally, the coordination would facilitate the occurrence of the outcome.
Thus someone's intention to wash the dishes might, for example, constrain the order of her actions so that that the prosecco glasses are done before greasy pans.
In this way, appealing to an intention concerning an outcome and its role in coordinating actions can sometimes allow us to explain in virtue of what several actions are collectively directed to that outcome.
Are there other facts in virtue of which  multiple actions involving just one agent can be collectively directed to an outcome?</div><div class="notes">But some philosophers have argued that some actions have goals in virtue of motor

their action-coordinating role.</div><div class="slide"><div class="notes">Explaining the coordination of 
sequences of very small scale actions appears to involve representations but not, or not 
only, intentions.  To a first approximation, \emph{motor representation} is a label for 
such representations.  But why accept that motor representations exist?</div><div data-what="img.bkg" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">Suppose you are a cook who needs to take an egg from its box, crack it and put it (except for the shell) into a bowl ready for beating into a carbonara sauce.  
Even for such mundane, routine actions, the constraints on adequate performance can vary significantly depending on subtle variations in context. For example, the position of a hot pan may require altering the trajectory along which the egg is transported, or time pressures may mean that the action must be performed unusually swiftly on this occasion.
Further, many of the constraints on performance involve relations between actions occurring at different times.
To illustrate, how tightly you need to grip the egg now depends, among other things, on the forces to which you will subject the egg in lifting it later.
It turns out that people reliably grip objects such as eggs just tightly enough across a range of conditions in which the optimal tightness of grip varies.
This indicates (along with much other evidence) that information about the cook’s anticipated future hand and arm movements appropriately influences how tightly she initially grips the egg (compare \citealp{kawato:1999_internal}).
This anticipatory control of grasp, 
like several other features of action performance (\citealp[see][chapter 1]{rosenbaum:2010_human} for more examples),
is not plausibly a consequence of mindless physiology, nor of intention and practical reasoning.
This is one reason for postulating motor representations, which characteristically play a role in coordinating sequences of very small scale actions such as grasping an egg in order to lift it.%
\footnote{% 
Much more to be said about what motor representations are; for instance, see \citet{butterfill:2012_intention} for the view that motor representations can be distinguished by representational format.

An initially attractive, conservative 
view would be that they represent bodily configurations and joint displacements, 
or perhaps sequences of these, only.
However there is now a significant body of evidence that some motor representations 
do not specify particular sequences of bodily configurations and joint displacements, 
but rather represent outcomes such as the grasping of an egg or the pressing of a switch.  
These are outcomes which might, on different occasions, involve very different bodily 
configurations and joint displacements
(see \citealp{rizzolatti_functional_2010} for a selective review).</div><div class="notes">Such outcomes are abstract relative to bodily configurations and joint displacements

trigger processes which are like planning in some respects. 
These processes are like planning in that they involve starting with representations of relatively 
distal outcomes and gradually filling in details, resulting in a structure of motor representations 
that can be hierarchically arranged by the means-end relation \citep{bekkering:2000_imitation,
grafton:2007_evidence}. 
Processes triggered by motor representations of outcomes are also planning-like in that they 
involve selecting means for actions to be performed now in ways that anticipate future actions  
\citep{jeannerod_motor_2006,zhang:2007_planning,rosenbaum:2012_cognition}.</div></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><img src="/img/action_hierarchy_diagrams/Slide3.jpg" width="1024px" style="" class="bkg"/><div style="" class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="notes">Now in this action of moving a mug, there is a need, even for the single agent, to coordinate the 
exchange between her two hands. 
(If her action is fluid, 
she may proactively adjust her left hand in advance of the mug’s being lifted by her right hand 
\citep[compare][]{diedrichsen:2003_anticipatory,hugon:1982_anticipatory, lum:1992_feedforward}.) 
How could such tight coordination be achieved? 
Part of the answer involves the fact that motor representations and processes concerning the 
actions involving each hand are not entirely independent of each other. 
Rather there is a plan-like structure of motor representation for the whole action and motor 
representations concerning actions involving each hand are components of this larger plan-like structure. 
It is in part because they are components of a larger plan-like structure that the movements of 
one hand constrain and are constrained by the movements of the other hand.</div><div class="slide"><div data-what="img:eq(0)" data-css="{&quot;blur&quot;:&quot;2px&quot;}" data-options="{&quot;duration&quot;:500}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">But how is any of this relevant to our question about in virtue of what an individuals’ actions can
have a goal?</div><div class="notes">The idea is that motor representations can ground the directedness of actions to goals,
much as intentions can.

such as drawing lines with one hand while drawing circles with the

suggesting that motor representations for drawing circles can affect motor representations 
for drawing lines (Garbarini et al. 2012; 2013a; 2015a; 2015b; Garbarini and Pia 2013;

Many researchers have answered this question by appeal to one or another kind of shared intention.
What we have shown is that in some cases the right answer to the question involves 
motor representation rather than intention.
And, more tenatively, this suggests that there may be a role for motor representation
in characterising joint action.
Perhaps understanding joint action and shared intention requires appeal not just to intention, commitment and the rest,
but also to motor representation.</div></div></div></div></div></section></div></body></html>
