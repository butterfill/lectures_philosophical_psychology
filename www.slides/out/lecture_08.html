          <div class="notes">In this experiment by Brian Hare and colleagues, a subordinate chimpanzee makes predictions about a
dominant chimpanzee’s ability to retrieve food. They found that the subordinate’s predictions take
into account whether the dominant’s view was blocked while the food was placed. This could be
explained by the Third Principle. For the subordinate to predict that the dominant will not be able
to recover the food, it is sufficient to think: because the dominant did not encounter the food,
she will not be able to retrieve it.

food behind one of the occluders whereas in uninformed trials they could 
not see the baiting procedure. In misinformed trials, dominants witnessed 
the experimenter hiding food behind one of the occluders, and once the 
dominant’s visual access was blocked, the experimenter switched the food 
from its original location to the other occluder’ \citep{Hare:2001ph}.

ravens \citep{bugnyar:2016_ravens},
goats \citep{kaminski:2006_goats},
dogs \citep{kaminski:2009_domestic},

and chimpanzees \citep{melis:2006_chimpanzees,karg:2015_chimpanzees} reliably vary their actions in ways that are appropriate given facts about another’s mental states.
What could underpin such abilities to track others’ mental states?

          </div>
          <div class="notes handout">For you to \emph{track} someone’s mental state (such as a belief that there is food behind that rock)
is for there to be a process in you which nonaccidentally depends in some way on whether she has that
mental state.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Representing mental states is one way, but not the only way, of tracking them.
In principle it is possible to track mental states without representing them.
For example, it is possible, within limits, to track what another visually represents by representing her line of sight only.
More sophisticated illustrations of how you could in principle track mental states without representing them abound \citep[e.g.][pp.~571ff]{buckner:2014_semantic}.
What many
experiments actually measure is whether certain subjects can track mental states:
the question is whether changes in what another sees, believes or desires are reflected in subjects’ choices of route, caching behaviours, or anticipatory looking (say).
It is surely possible to infer what is represented by observing what is tracked.
But such inferences are never merely logical.

perfect knowledge of history and can conceptualise behaviours in any way imaginable. Although blind to
mental states, it can predict others’ future behaviours at least as well as any mindreader.</div>

        <div class="notes">Also a Krachun-like reaching measure:
‘After the competitor has acted in one of these two ways toward the container with the large grape,
the experimenter places opaque coverings completely over each container and moves the platform toward
the chimpanzee. Once the platform is in place before the chimpanzee, the chimpanzee is allowed to
choose one of the two containers (by pointing to it through a finger hole). Since the containers are
covered, the chimpanzee cannot make its choice by seeing the grape or grapes inside the containers.
Rather, to make its preferred choice (which we assume will be the remaining small grape in
competitor-first success trials and the large grape in competitor-first failure trials) the chimpanzee
must attend to the selection process of the competitor.’
