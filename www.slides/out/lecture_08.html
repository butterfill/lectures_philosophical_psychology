          <div class="notes">In this experiment by Brian Hare and colleagues, a subordinate chimpanzee makes predictions about a
dominant chimpanzee’s ability to retrieve food. They found that the subordinate’s predictions take
into account whether the dominant’s view was blocked while the food was placed. This could be
explained by the Third Principle. For the subordinate to predict that the dominant will not be able
to recover the food, it is sufficient to think: because the dominant did not encounter the food,
she will not be able to retrieve it.

food behind one of the occluders whereas in uninformed trials they could 
not see the baiting procedure. In misinformed trials, dominants witnessed 
the experimenter hiding food behind one of the occluders, and once the 
dominant’s visual access was blocked, the experimenter switched the food 
from its original location to the other occluder’ \citep{Hare:2001ph}.

ravens \citep{bugnyar:2016_ravens},
goats \citep{kaminski:2006_goats},
dogs \citep{kaminski:2009_domestic},

and chimpanzees \citep{melis:2006_chimpanzees,karg:2015_chimpanzees} reliably vary their actions in ways that are appropriate given facts about another’s mental states.
What could underpin such abilities to track others’ mental states?

          </div>
          <div class="notes handout">For you to \emph{track} someone’s mental state (such as a belief that there is food behind that rock)
is for there to be a process in you which nonaccidentally depends in some way on whether she has that
mental state.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Representing mental states is one way, but not the only way, of tracking them.
In principle it is possible to track mental states without representing them.
For example, it is possible, within limits, to track what another visually represents by representing her line of sight only.
More sophisticated illustrations of how you could in principle track mental states without representing them abound \citep[e.g.][pp.~571ff]{buckner:2014_semantic}.
What many
experiments actually measure is whether certain subjects can track mental states:
the question is whether changes in what another sees, believes or desires are reflected in subjects’ choices of route, caching behaviours, or anticipatory looking (say).
It is surely possible to infer what is represented by observing what is tracked.
But such inferences are never merely logical.

perfect knowledge of history and can conceptualise behaviours in any way imaginable. Although blind to
mental states, it can predict others’ future behaviours at least as well as any mindreader.</div>

infer which is larger from the failed reach of the human competitor)...

        <div class="notes">Also a Krachun-like reaching measure:
‘After the competitor has acted in one of these two ways toward the container with the large grape,
the experimenter places opaque coverings completely over each container and moves the platform toward
the chimpanzee. Once the platform is in place before the chimpanzee, the chimpanzee is allowed to
choose one of the two containers (by pointing to it through a finger hole). Since the containers are
covered, the chimpanzee cannot make its choice by seeing the grape or grapes inside the containers.
Rather, to make its preferred choice (which we assume will be the remaining small grape in
competitor-first success trials and the large grape in competitor-first failure trials) the chimpanzee
must attend to the selection process of the competitor.’

Two versions of this objection: (a) cross-species:
How confident are we that ringtailed lemurs are doing what chimpanzees are doing?
(b) within an individual:
In humans and other animals, tracking mental states likely involves many different 
processes, including plenty of which that rely on simple cues.

\citet{Call:2008di} qualify their claim by adding that ‘chimpanzees probably do not understand

      </div>
      <div class="notes">This is true.
The emergence in human development of the most sophisticated abilities to represent mental states
probably depends on rich social interactions involving conversation about the mental
\citep{Slaughter:1996fv, peterson:2003_opening, moeller:2006_relations}, on linguistic abilities
\citep{milligan:2007_language,kovacs:2009_early},
(\citet[p.~760]{moeller:2006_relations}: ‘Our results provide support for the concept that access
to conversations about the mind is important for deaf children’s ToM development, in that there was
a significant relationship between maternal talk about mental states and deaf children’s
performance on verbal ToM tasks.’)
and on capacities to attend to, hold in mind and inhibit things \citep{benson:2013_individual,
devine:2014_relations}.
These are all scarce or absent in chimpanzees and other nonhumans.
So it seems unlikely that the ways humans at their most reflective represent mental states will
match the ways nonhumans represent mental states.
Reflecting on how adult humans talk about mental states is no way to understand how others
represent them.
But then what could enable us to understand how nonhuman animals represent mental states?

I take Byrne’s study
to demonstrate that chimps are capable of sophisticated behaviour reading.
But how might they represent behaviours?

        <div class="notes">The procedure for preparing a nettle to eat while avoiding contact with its stings is shown in
\vref{fig:byrne_2003_fig1}. It involves multiple steps. Some steps may be repeated varying numbers of
times, and not all steps occur in every case. The fact that gorillas can learn this and other
procedures for acquiring and preparing food by observing others’ behaviour suggests that they have
sophisticated behaviour reading abilities \citep[p.~513]{Byrne:2003wx}. If we understood the nature
of these behaviour reading abilities and their limits, we might be better able to understand their
abilities to track mental states too.

reliance on communication by language.
We can therefore think of behaviour reading as foundational for any kind

‘Nettles, Laportea alatipes, are an important food of mountain gorillas in Rwanda (Watts 1984), 
rich in protein and low in secondary compounds and structural carbohydrate (Waterman et al. 1983). 
Unfortunately for the gorillas, this plant is 'defended' by powerful stinging hairs, 
especially dense on the stem, petioles and leaf-edges. 
All gorillas in the local population process nettles in broadly the same way, 
a technique that minimizes contact of sting- ing hairs with their hands and 
lips (Byrne & Byrne 1991; figure 1). A series of small transformations is 
made to plant material: stripping leaves off stems, accumulating
larger bundles of leaves, detachment of petioles, picking out unwanted debris, 
and finally folding a package of leaf blades within a single leaf before 
ingestion. The means by which each small change is made are idiosyncratic and
variable with context (Byrne & Byrne 1993), thus presum- ably best learned 
by individual experience. However, the overall sequence of five discrete 
stages in the process is standardized and appears to be essential for efficiency
(Byrne et al. 2001a).’ \citep[pp.~531--2]{Byrne:2003wx}

food bundle (Byrne & Russon 1998).’ \citep[pp.~532]{Byrne:2003wx}

            <div class="handout notes">Our primary concern here with behaviour reading is as a potential basis for abilities to track others’ mental states without representing them.
But behaviour reading is plausibly important in other ways.
In mindreaders, behaviour reading is thought to be useful or even necessary for identifying intentions and other mental states (\citealp[p.~861]{Newtson:1977dw}; \citealp[p.~708]{Baldwin:2001rn}).
Behaviour reading may also matter for efficiently representing events \citep{Kurby:2008bk}, identifing the likely effects of actions \citep{Byrne:1999jk}, predicting when an event likely to be of interest will occur \citep[p.~121]{Swallow:2008cf},
and learning through observation how to do things \citep{Byrne:2003wx}.
And of course a special case of pure behaviour reading, ‘speech perception’, underpins communication by language in humans.

            <p>segmentation: Where does an action begin an end?</p>
            <div class="notes">Behaviour reading involves at least three components: segmentation, categorisation and structure extraction.
First, it is necessary to segment continuous streams of bodily movements into units of interest.
Adult humans can readily impose boundaries on continuous sequences of behaviour \citep{Newtson:1976ni,Zacks:2001ua,Kurby:2008bk}, as can infants \citep{Baldwin:2001rs}.
Segmentation is probably complicated by the fact that units are not performed one after another but can overlap, as when you bat away a fly while squeezing a lemon and talking on the phone.
A further complication is that identifying unit boundaries probably involves taking into account the context in which a behaviour occurs \citep[p.~847]{Newtson:1977dw}.
How could segmentation be achieved?
Commencement and completion of a goal or subgoal typically coincide with dramatic changes in physical features of the movements such as velocity \citep{Zacks:2001vo}.
Baldwin and Baird express this idea graphically with the notion of a ‘ballistic trajectory’ that provides an ‘envelope’ for a unit of action \citep[p.~174]{Baldwin:2001rs}.
Research using schematic animations has shown that adults can use a variety of movement features to group behavioural chunks into units
\citep{Zacks:2004vd,Hard:2006gr}.
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
              <p>categorisation: What is the type of that action?</p>
              <div class="notes">A second component of behaviour reading is categorisation.
Adult humans spontaneously label units of behaviour as ‘running’, ‘grasping’, or ‘searching’ (say).
This is categorisation: two units which may involve quite different bodily configurations and joint displacements and which may occur in quite different contexts are nevertheless treated as equivalent.
How are categories identified in pure behaviour reading?
One possibility is that some categorisation processes involve mirroring motor cognition.
When a monkey or a human observes another’s action, there are often motor representations in her that would normally occur if it were her, the observer, who was performing the action (see \citealp[][]{rizzolatti_functional_2010,rizzolatti_mirrors_2008} for reviews).
Further, in preparing, performing and monitoring actions, units of action are represented motorically in ways that abstract from particular patterns of joint displacements and bodily configurations \citep[e.g.][]{rizzolatti:1988_functional, Rizzolatti:2001ug, hamilton:2008_action, cattaneo:2010_state-dependent,Umilta:2001zr, villiger:2010_activity, koch:2010_resonance}.
And, in observation as performance, what is represented motorically depends on contextual factors such as the presence of particular objects on which certain actions might be performed (\citealp{Gallese:2011uq}).
Taken together, these findings indicate that %there may be a deep connection between processes involved in action performance and one process of categorisation in behaviour reading.
%Perhaps
one process by which units of action are categorised is the process by which, in other contexts, your own actions are prepared.

            <div class="slide">
              <p>structure extraction: Are these actions related to those?</p>
              <div class="notes">A third component of behaviour reading is structure extraction.
Many actions can be analysed as a structure of goals hierarchically ordered by the means-ends relation
A behaviour reader should be able to extract some or all of this structure.
But how?
Units of behaviour that are all involved in bringing about a single outcome are more likely to occur in succession than chunks not so related.
This suggests that transitional probabilities in the sequence of units could in principle be used to identify larger structures of units, much as phonemes can be grouped into words by means of tracking transitional probabilities \citep{Saffran:1996aj,Gomez:2000jr}.
We know that human adults can learn to group small chunks of behaviour into larger word-like units on the basis of statistical features alone \citep{Baldwin:2008mw}.
A statistical learning mechanism required for discerning such units is automatic \citep{Fiser:2001cx}, domain-general \citep{Kirkham:2002cj} and probably present in human infants \citep{saffran:2007_dog} as well as other species including monkeys \citep{Hauser:2001oo}, pigeons \citep{herbranson:_artificial},
songbirds \citep{abe:2011_songbirds} and rats \citep{Toro:2005ma,murphy:2008_rule}.
It is therefore plausible that at least some animals’ pure behaviour reading abilities enable them to extract some of the hierarchical structure of actions.

          <p class="center">Limits of Behaviour Reading?</p>
          <div class="notes">What are the limits of pure behaviour reading?
While little is currently known about pure behaviour reading outside of communication by language,
it is perhaps reasonable to assume that structure extraction depends on domain-general learning mechanisms.
After all, such mechanisms appear sufficient and there is currently little evidence for domain-specific mechanisms.
%(even in adult humans, the most abundant lab animals)
This assumption allows us to make conjectures about the limits of pure behaviour reading.

In this case, my retrieving the object depends on my having had it in my line of sight, but there is an arbitrary interval between these events.
The hypothesis is that structures involving non-adjacent dependencies are relatively difficult to learn and identify, and that difficulty increases as the number of non-adjacent dependencies increases.%
\footnote{%
Compare \citet[][]{vries:2012_processing}.
Of course, whether non-adjacent dependencies are intrinsically difficult depends on the cognitive architecture \citep{udden:2012_implicit}.
There is evidence that monkeys \citep{ravignani:2013_action} and chimpanzees \citep{sonnweber:2015_non} can learn patterns involving one non-adjacent dependency.

          <div class="notes">To generalise, suppose we assume that extracting structure in pure behaviour reading involves domain-general learning mechanisms only.
Then whenever an animal’s abilities to track others’ mental states are underpinned by pure behaviour reading only, her abilities to learn and identify patterns should be subject to domain-general limits.
Since birdsongs are discriminable and involve diverse behavioural structures \citep{berwick:2011_songs}, we might take the \emph{Birdsong Limit} as a rough working hypothesis: structures not found in birdsong cannot be extracted in pure behaviour reading.
