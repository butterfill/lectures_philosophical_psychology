An account of radical interpretation is an account of how you could 
in principle infer facts about actions and mental states from
non-mental evidence.
This is the fundamental project in theorising about social cognition
(as I’ll explain shortly [by invoking Marr’s levels]).

Donald Davidson and David Lewis have both used the term ‘radical interpretation’.
But Lewis is interested in how what I am calling ‘The Evidence’ determines facts about
the mind.  This is a *metaphysical* question.
By contrast, Davidson is interested in the possibility of inferring The Mind from
The Evidence.  He is not assuming---and, I think, does not belive, that the Evidence
metaphysically determines The Mind (although he’s sometimes interpreted as so believing).
Davidson’s project (and the part of Dennett’s we’re interested in) is
epistemological, not metaphysical.

It dictates, on a first pass, that we attribute the familiar list of highest, or most basic, desires to people: survival, absence of pain, food, comfort, procreation, entertainment.’ \citep[p.~20]{Dennett:1987sf}

From the context, I think Dennett’s idea is that, in essence, we all desire 
a small number of basic things but differ in our beliefs about how to get these.

This involves a bit of maths: given time signals from four different satellites,
you can work out what time it is and how far you are away from each
of the satellites.
Then, if you know where the satellites are and what shape the Earth is,
you can work out where on Earth you are.

The algorithm will be different from the computational theory: it is a procedure

    <div class="notes">This is why Davidson says that a theory of radical interpretation isn’t
‘meant to throw any direct light on how in real life we come to understand each other’.
What he means is that it isn’t about the representations and algorithsm, nor about the 
hardware implementation--the neurophysiology in our case--of social cognition.

      <div class="notes">But he’s also right that all 
‘[a]ll understanding of the speech [and thoughts] of another involves radical interpretation’.
This follows trivially from the fact that 
a theory of radical interpretation is supposed to be a computational description
of  social cognition.

      <div class="notes">Finally, the view I’m offering (a theory of radical interpretation is supposed to provide
a computational description of social cognition) makes sense of a puzzle about 
Dennett’s claim that people use the Intentional Strategy all the time.
The puzzle is to understand how he could know this without doing some research.
The answer, I think, is that Dennett’s Intentional Stance, like any theory of
radical interpretation, isn’t a theory about how individuals understand each other;
it is a theory about what it is to understand each other---that is, a computational
description of social cognition.

          </div>
          <div class="slide notes show">
            <p class="indent">- your ‘place in the world’ (location?)</p>
            <p class="indent">- your biological needs</p>
          </div>
          <div class="notes">So I think it is clearly a mistake to say that the Intentional Strategy 
is an account of radical interpretation.
Minimally, an account of radical interpretation needs to explain how 
the interpreter can identify the distinctive actions, emotions, 
beliefs, desires and other
mental states of an individual.  
The Intentional Strategy appears fundamentally unsuited to this purpose
because the Intentional Strategy involves making very little use of evidence.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">By itself,
this is not a deep objection to Dennett.  You might say, his theory 
is fine as far as it goes; it was only meant to cover a couple of basic
principles, leaving much of the project for future development.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">But what exercises me is that we don’t have an account of radical interpretation.
We have yet to explain how 
an interpreter can identify the distinctive actions, emotions, 
beliefs, desires and other
mental states of another individual.

          <div class="notes">Let me start by reminding you what the aim of an account of radical interpretation is.
An account of radical interpretation is an account of how you could 
in principle infer facts about actions and mental states from
non-mental evidence.
This is the fundamental project in theorising about social cognition
(as I’ll explain shortly).

            <div class="notes">I’m still not completely happy that I’ve properly explained the evidence 
which is the starting point.
Perhaps this is a better way to put it:
the evidence is evidence that you could possess in advance of knowing
what any particular individual believes, desires, intends and so on.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">I’ve just been saying that Dennett’s account of the Intentional Strategy
isn’t much use as an accounnt of radical interpretation because it doesn’t
explain what sort of evidence would be useful in inferring facts about 
minds.
Fortunately Davidson’s theory is more illuminating ...

            <div class="notes">Holding true is an attitude Ayesha has to a sentence.
To hold a sentence true is to have a belief.
So the evidence we are starting with is really evidence about beliefs.
But, importantly, can know that Ayesha holds a sentence true 
without knowing what the sentence means and so without knowing
what Ayesha believes.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">So evidence of this kind is evidence that is in principle available to a radical
interpreter at the start.

            <div class="notes">At any particular time there will be many 
propositions p such that Ayesha comes to hold S true because p.
As already mentioned, Ayesha comes to hold the sentence ‘It is raining’
true because it is raining, because she has her eyes open 
and because there are splashes in the puddle on the roof outside her window.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">There is, then, no hope of inferring what Ayesha believes 
from a single change in Ayesha’s holding a sentence true.

            <div class="notes">But we can consider many different events of Ayesha coming to hold a sentence true
at different times.
Consider, for instance, that on one occasion Ayesha comes to hold the sentence ‘It is raining’
true because she has her eyes open.
On another occasion, she comes to hold this sentence true while cycling through 
an intense storm; on this occasion, the fact that she has her eyes open plays no role
in her coming to hold the sentence ‘It is raining’ true.

            <div class="notes">The evidence confirms or falsifies a generalisation of the form, 
Ayesha comes to hold S true because p.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">The hope is this: if we have enough evidence, we will find that 
the only generalisation supported by all the evidence is this one:
Ayesha comes to hold the sentence ‘It is raining’ true because it is raining.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="slide">

            <div data-what=".sentence-S" data-cls="bkg-invert" class="dv dv-addclass"></div>
            <div class="notes">This is unrealistic, of course.
However Davidson’s theory doesn’t strictly require this because sentences 
are things with structure.  They contain elements, the words, which reoccur
in different sentences.
Davidson exploits this in making his theory of radical interpretation
much more sophisticated than the simplified version I am describing,
and avoiding the implausible notion that we would observe Ayesha coming to hold 
each sentence true millions of times.
But we can ignore the complication as it won’t be central to our interests in
social cognition (it would be more relevant for philosophy of language).
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="slide">
            <div data-what=".sentence-S" data-cls="bkg-invert" class="dv dv-removeclass"></div>
            <div class="notes">So, idealising and simplifying, we have lots of evidence which,
for each of many sentences like ‘It’s raining’, supports a unique 
generalisation about why Ayesha comes to hold that sentence true.
For example, the only generalisation supported by all the evidence
for the sentence ‘It’s raining’ is the one that says Ayesha
holds this sentence true because it’s raining.

            <p class="em-above">Assumption:</p>
            <p>Ayesha’s beliefs true</p>
            <div class="notes">We already saw that this assumption is required by Dennett’s Intentional Strategy.
The assumption allows us to draw a conclusion about meaning:
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="slide">
            <p class="em-above">Conclusion:</p>
            <p>S is <span class="tiff">true if and only if</span><span> p</span></p>

            <div class="notes">For our purposes you could replace this by ‘S means that p’, if you 
believed in meanings.
(There are good reasons for appealing to truth conditions but they aren’t
central on this course.)

          <div class="notes">On Davidson’s account of radical interpretation, we can think of its upshot
as an assignment of propositions to sentences.
The propositions give the truth conditions, or meanings, of the sentences and 
so enable us to identify the target’s beliefs and other propositional attitudes.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Because the evidence Davidson considers is attitudes towards whole sentences,
it turns out that, for any assignment of propositions to sentences,
there are ways of generating an alternative assigment of propositions to sentences
which is exactly as well supported by the evidence as the original assignment
of propositions to sentences is.

          <div class="notes">So on Davidson’s account of radical interpretation, there is no possibility

If I gave you a computational theory of the GPS device that suffered from 
indeterminacy, you would rightly reject that theory because the device
can, as a matter of fact, determine which side of the planet it is on.
But should we take the same attitude towards Davidson’s theory.

            <div class="notes">Davidson might take this horn of the dilemma and just insist that 
his view of what an account of radical interpretation aims to achieve

It doesn’t start from no insight into what someone intends, just relatively little.

            <div class="notes">I think this response would be unsatisfactory given our interests in 
social cognition.  The hardest part is surely to understand the step from
*no* insight into others’ minds and actions to *some* such insight.
If Davidson’s account of radical interpretation is really just about 
the step from *some* insight into others’ minds and actions to a bit more 
insight, it might be interesting but it isn’t the theory we were looking for.
It won’t after all provide us with a computational theory of social cognition.

            <div class="notes">Can Davidson instead take the first horn of the dilemma and say that the changes 
in attitude are represented merely as sequences of joint displacements,
bodily configurations and sounds?
            </div>
            <div class="notes">He might insist that as long as there is some account of how we get from the
joint displacement to the changes in attitude towards the sentence, 
there is no problem.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">So on this horn, Davidson’s radical interpretation project is the computational
theory of social cognition which we are looking for.  But it is incomplete because 
it doesn’t include an account of the transition from
joint displacements, bodily configurations and their effects (such as sounds)
to changes in attitude towards the truth of sentences.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">On the face of it, this doesn’t sound like there’s going to be an objection
to Davidson here.  But things get very interesting when we consider what is
currently known about how this transition is made.
Essentially, we will see that the capacities involved in getting from joint displacements,
bodily configurations and their effects (such as sounds) to goal-directed actions
provides a significant form of social cognition in its own right.

          <div class="notes">I think all of these objections arise from a single source.
Davidson’s account of radical interpretation starts and ends with 
linguistic expressions of changes in attitudes towards whole sentences.
It doesn’t consider simple object-directed actions like reaching for a mug
or catching a ball, and it doesn’t consider nonlinguistic communicative 
activities like pointing; nor does it consider expressions of emotion like 
some smiles and grimaces.

We have a choice.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">One possibility would be to consider whether we can 
perceptually experience mental states.
This appears to involve taking a position substantially at odds with Davidson’s account
of radical interpretation insofar as the computational theory will look
quite different for perception ... the evidence that we start from will
not be linguistic expressions of changes in attitude towards sentences,
and the sorts of inference we make will probably not have the causal character
of the inferences Davidson makes use of in his account of radical interpretation.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">A different possibility is to try to continue developing Davidson’s account of
radical interpretation by thinking about this question:
How do humans make the transition from bodily configurations, joint displacements
and their effects (e.g. sounds) to goal-directed actions?
          </div>
          <div class="notes">[I think that these are not strictly speaking different alterantives.
Categorical perception of expressions of emotion is a form of goal ascription,
just as speech perception is.
So the Teleological Stance provides the computational description common to the
most fundamental forms of social cognition.]
