Donald Davidson and David Lewis have both used the term ‘radical interpretation’.
But Lewis is interested in how what I am calling ‘The Evidence’ determines facts about
the mind.  This is a *metaphysical* question.
By contrast, Davidson is interested in the possibility of inferring The Mind from
The Evidence.  He is not assuming---and, I think, does not belive, that the Evidence
metaphysically determines The Mind (although he’s sometimes interpreted as so believing).
Davidson’s project (and the part of Dennett’s we’re interested in) is
epistemological, not metaphysical.</div><div class="notes">[NB: this is particularly important because we’re talking about Dennett]</div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".infer" data-cls="bkg-invert" class="dv dv-removeclass"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><div class="handout">&nbsp;</div><div class="handout">\section{The Intentional Stance}</div><div class="notes notes-header-tex">&nbsp;</div><div class="notes notes-header-tex">\section{The Intentional Stance}</div><div class="notes">The ‘Intentional Stance’ (also ‘Intentional Strategy’) is Dennett’s name for

for discovering time and location.

However Davidson’s theory doesn’t strictly require this because sentences 
are things with structure.  They contain elements, the words, which reoccur
in different sentences.
Davidson exploits this in making his theory of radical interpretation
much more sophisticated than the simplified version I am describing,
and avoiding the implausible notion that we would observe Ayesha coming to hold 
each sentence true millions of times.

for each of many sentences like ‘It’s raining’, supports a unique

holds this sentence true because it’s raining.</div></div><div class="slide"><p class="em-above">Assumption:</p><p>Ayesha’s beliefs true</p><div class="notes">We already saw that this assumption is required by Dennett’s Intentional Strategy.

\label{twin_pram}
Seeing you struggling to get your twin pram onto a bus and noticing you have 
the haggard look of a new parent, a passing stranger  grabs the front wheels 
and makes eye contact with you, raising her eyebrows and smiling.
(The noise of the street rules out talking.)   
In this way she signals that she is about to act jointly with you.   
Since you are fully committed to getting your pram onto the bus,
you know what the sole goal of your own actions will be.
But you also know that the stranger will engage in joint action with you,
which means that, taken together, her actions and your actions will have a collective goal.
This may enable you to infer the goal of the stranger's imminent actions: 
her goal is your goal, to get the pram onto the bus.</div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><img src="/img/whitney.png" width="1024px" style="" class="bkg"/><div style="" class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="handout notes">\begin{enumerate}

ascription where actions involve novel uses for tools.
How could your-goal-is-my-goal mitigate the problem in such cases?
Imagine we are interacting with a young child,
Ayesha,
and want her to understand how a new tool is used.  
It is difficult to convey this to her directly.  
So we first get her interested in achieving an outcome that would require the new tool,
knowing that she will perform actions directed to achieving this outcome.  
We then signal to Ayesha that we will act jointly with her.  
Now she is in a position to know what the goal of our action will be when we deploy the tool.  
She is able to identify this goal 
despite being unable to recognize it as an end to which our tool-using action is a means.
She is able to identify this goal 
because she knows that this is her goal
and that we were attempting to engage in joint action with her.
This is one illustration of how 
interacting interpreters have at their disposal ways of
identifying the goals of actions involving novel uses of tools
which are unavailable to interpreters who can only observe.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".inversion-of-demand" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">As this example indicates,
exploiting your-goal-is-my-goal 
can shift the burden of identifying goals from a mindreader to her target.
In the example Ayesha is the focal mindreader and we are her target;
but her success in identifying the goal of our actions
depends on this,
that our willingness to act jointly with her is based on \emph{our} knowledge of the goals of \emph{her} actions.
In purely observational mindreading, the target's beliefs about the goals of the mindreader's actions are not normally relevant (except, of course, when the mindreader is ascribing such beliefs).
But interacting mindreaders who rely on your-goal-is-my-goal
thereby rely on their targets' having correctly identified the goals of their actions.
Of course this is sometimes a reason not to rely on your-goal-is-my-goal.
But where the target understands relevant means-ends relations,
such as actions involving novel tools,
the your-goal-is-my-goal route to knowledge of others' goals may sometimes be the only option.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".eg:eq(1)" data-cls="bkg-grey-row " class="dv dv-removeclass"></div><div data-what=".eg:eq(2)" data-cls="bkg-grey-row " class="dv dv-addclass"></div><div class="notes">This is a bit of a problem ...</div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><div style="" class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><p class="huge-glow">conclusion 3</p><div class="notes show"><p class="center">Interaction makes available routes to knowledge of the goals of actions.</p></div><div class="notes handout">Simple forms of interaction enable correct goal ascription in

Simple forms of interaction simultaneously give rise to a
need to identify false beliefs and a means of distinguishing

This suggests a conjecture: the ability to track false beliefs may be a
consequence of the ability to engage in simple forms of social interaction.</div></div></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><div style="" class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><p class="invert">Conclusions</p><div class="hem-around-children"><div class="c1 slide"><p>1.
