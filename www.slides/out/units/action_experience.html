According to the Action Index Conjecture,
motor representations of outcomes structure 
experiences, imaginings and (prospective) memories
in ways which provide opportunities for attention to actions directed to those outcomes.
Forming intentions concerning an outcome can influence attention to the action,
which can influence the persistence of a motor representation of the outcome."/><meta name="keywords" content="philosophy, psychology, action, joint action, metarepresentation, perception"/><meta name="author" content=""/><meta name="generator" content="DocPad v6.78.4" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"/><!-- - lato font--><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,400,900,400italic" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=The+Girl+Next+Door" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/><!--if lt IE 9script(async src="http://html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js")

connected systems that work largely independently of each other. To a certain extent it’s fine for
them to go their own way; and of course since they all get the same inputs (what with being parts of
a single subject), there are limits on how separate the ways the go can be. Still, it’s often good
for them to be aligned, at least eventually.</div><div class="notes">Experience is what enables there to be nonaccidental eventual alignment of largely independent

an object index is the mental counterpart of a finger \citep[p.~68]{pylyshyn:1989_role}.</div><div class="notes">The interesting thing about object indexes is that a system of object
indexes (at least one, maybe more)
appears to underpin cognitive processes which are not
strictly perceptual but also do not involve beliefs or knowledge states.

a system of object indexes has been challenged.  
See \citet[p.\ 59]{scholl:2009_what}:
\begin{quote}
`I suggest that what Pylyshyn’s (2004) experiments show is exactly what they intuitively 
seem to show: We can keep track of the targets in MOT, but not which one is which. 
[...]
all of this seems easily explained [...] by the view 
that MOT is simply realized by split object-based attention to the MOT targets as a set.'
\end{quote}
It is surely right that the existence of MOT does not, all by itself,
provide support for the existence of a system of object indexes.
However, contra what Scholl seems to be suggesting here, the MOT paradigm 
can be adapated to provide such evidence.
Thus, for instance, \citet{horowitz:2010_direction} show that, in a MOT paradigm, observers 
can report the direction of one or two targets without advance knowledge of which 
targets' directions they will be asked to report.)</div></div><p class="source">Pylyshyn 2001, figure 6</p></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><div style="" class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="notes">There is a behavioural marker of object-indexes called the object-specific preview benefit.

Your task is to say whether this letter is one of the letters that appeared at the start or whether it is a new letter.
Consider just those cases in which the answer is yes: the letter at the end is one of those which you saw at the start.
Of interest is how long this takes you to respond in two cases: when the letter appears on the same object at the start and end, and, in contrast, when the letter appears on one object at the start and a different object at the end.
It turns out that most people can answer the question more quickly in the first case.
That is, they are faster when a letter appears on the same object twice than when it appears on two different objects 
\citep{Kahneman:1992xt}.
This difference in response times is the
