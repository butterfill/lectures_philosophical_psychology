‘Nettles, Laportea alatipes, are an important food of mountain gorillas in Rwanda (Watts 1984), 
rich in protein and low in secondary compounds and structural carbohydrate (Waterman et al. 1983). 
Unfortunately for the gorillas, this plant is 'defended' by powerful stinging hairs, 
especially dense on the stem, petioles and leaf-edges. 
All gorillas in the local population process nettles in broadly the same way, 
a technique that minimizes contact of sting- ing hairs with their hands and 
lips (Byrne & Byrne 1991; figure 1). A series of small transformations is 
made to plant material: stripping leaves off stems, accumulating
larger bundles of leaves, detachment of petioles, picking out unwanted debris, 
and finally folding a package of leaf blades within a single leaf before 
ingestion. The means by which each small change is made are idiosyncratic and
variable with context (Byrne & Byrne 1993), thus presum- ably best learned 
by individual experience. However, the overall sequence of five discrete 
stages in the process is standardized and appears to be essential for efficiency
(Byrne et al. 2001a).’ \citep[pp.~531--2]{Byrne:2003wx}</div><div class="notes">‘Like other complex feeding tasks in great apes, preparing nettles is a hierarchically 
organized skill, showing considerable flexibility: stages that are occasionally 
unnecessary are omitted, and sections of the process (of one or several ordered stages) 
are often repeated iteratively to a criterion apparently based on an adequate size of 
food bundle (Byrne & Russon 1998).’ \citep[pp.~532]{Byrne:2003wx}</div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><p>Behaviour reading matters for</p><div class="hem-around-children"><p>identifying mental states</p><div class="notes">Because ascriptions of mental states are based on observed behaviours.</div><div class="slide"><p>identifying effects of actions</p><p>predicting when an event of interest will occur</p><p>learning how to do things</p></div><div class="handout notes">Our primary concern here with behaviour reading is as a potential basis for abilities to track others’ mental states without representing them.
But behaviour reading is plausibly important in other ways.
In mindreaders, behaviour reading is thought to be useful or even necessary for identifying intentions and other mental states (\citealp[p.~861]{Newtson:1977dw}; \citealp[p.~708]{Baldwin:2001rn}).
Behaviour reading may also matter for efficiently representing events \citep{Kurby:2008bk}, identifing the likely effects of actions \citep{Byrne:1999jk}, predicting when an event likely to be of interest will occur \citep[p.~121]{Swallow:2008cf},
and learning through observation how to do things \citep{Byrne:2003wx}.
And of course a special case of pure behaviour reading, ‘speech perception’, underpins communication by language in humans.</div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><div class="hem-around-children"><p>segmentation: Where does an action begin an end?</p><div class="notes">Behaviour reading involves at least three components: segmentation, categorisation and structure extraction.
First, it is necessary to segment continuous streams of bodily movements into units of interest.
Adult humans can readily impose boundaries on continuous sequences of behaviour \citep{Newtson:1976ni,Zacks:2001ua,Kurby:2008bk}, as can infants \citep{Baldwin:2001rs}.
Segmentation is probably complicated by the fact that units are not performed one after another but can overlap, as when you bat away a fly while squeezing a lemon and talking on the phone.
A further complication is that identifying unit boundaries probably involves taking into account the context in which a behaviour occurs \citep[p.~847]{Newtson:1977dw}.
How could segmentation be achieved?
Commencement and completion of a goal or subgoal typically coincide with dramatic changes in physical features of the movements such as velocity \citep{Zacks:2001vo}.
Baldwin and Baird express this idea graphically with the notion of a ‘ballistic trajectory’ that provides an ‘envelope’ for a unit of action \citep[p.~174]{Baldwin:2001rs}.
Research using schematic animations has shown that adults can use a variety of movement features to group behavioural chunks into units
\citep{Zacks:2004vd,Hard:2006gr}.</div><div class="slide"><p>categorisation: What is the type of that action?</p><div class="notes">A second component of behaviour reading is categorisation.
Adult humans spontaneously label units of behaviour as ‘running’, ‘grasping’, or ‘searching’ (say).
This is categorisation: two units which may involve quite different bodily configurations and joint displacements and which may occur in quite different contexts are nevertheless treated as equivalent.
How are categories identified in pure behaviour reading?
One possibility is that some categorisation processes involve mirroring motor cognition.
When a monkey or a human observes another’s action, there are often motor representations in her that would normally occur if it were her, the observer, who was performing the action (see \citealp[][]{rizzolatti_functional_2010,rizzolatti_mirrors_2008} for reviews).
Further, in preparing, performing and monitoring actions, units of action are represented motorically in ways that abstract from particular patterns of joint displacements and bodily configurations \citep[e.g.][]{rizzolatti:1988_functional, Rizzolatti:2001ug, hamilton:2008_action, cattaneo:2010_state-dependent,Umilta:2001zr, villiger:2010_activity, koch:2010_resonance}.
And, in observation as performance, what is represented motorically depends on contextual factors such as the presence of particular objects on which certain actions might be performed (\citealp{Gallese:2011uq}).
Taken together, these findings indicate that %there may be a deep connection between processes involved in action performance and one process of categorisation in behaviour reading.
%Perhaps
one process by which units of action are categorised is the process by which, in other contexts, your own actions are prepared.</div></div><div class="slide"><p>structure extraction: Are these actions related to those?</p><div class="notes">A third component of behaviour reading is structure extraction.
Many actions can be analysed as a structure of goals hierarchically ordered by the means-ends relation
A behaviour reader should be able to extract some or all of this structure.
But how?
Units of behaviour that are all involved in bringing about a single outcome are more likely to occur in succession than chunks not so related.
This suggests that transitional probabilities in the sequence of units could in principle be used to identify larger structures of units, much as phonemes can be grouped into words by means of tracking transitional probabilities \citep{Saffran:1996aj,Gomez:2000jr}.
We know that human adults can learn to group small chunks of behaviour into larger word-like units on the basis of statistical features alone \citep{Baldwin:2008mw}.
A statistical learning mechanism required for discerning such units is automatic \citep{Fiser:2001cx}, domain-general \citep{Kirkham:2002cj} and probably present in human infants \citep{saffran:2007_dog} as well as other species including monkeys \citep{Hauser:2001oo}, pigeons \citep{herbranson:_artificial},
songbirds \citep{abe:2011_songbirds} and rats \citep{Toro:2005ma,murphy:2008_rule}.
It is therefore plausible that at least some animals’ pure behaviour reading abilities enable them to extract some of the hierarchical structure of actions.</div></div><div class="slide"><p>goal ascription: What is the goal of those actions?</p><div class="notes">Here I think the teleological stance (which may involve motor processes)

While little is currently known about pure behaviour reading outside of communication by language,
it is perhaps reasonable to assume that structure extraction depends on domain-general learning mechanisms.
After all, such mechanisms appear sufficient and there is currently little evidence for domain-specific mechanisms.
%(even in adult humans, the most abundant lab animals)
This assumption allows us to make conjectures about the limits of pure behaviour reading.</div><div class="notes">One limit concerns the kinds of structure which animals of a given species might extract.

In this case, my retrieving the object depends on my having had it in my line of sight, but there is an arbitrary interval between these events.
The hypothesis is that structures involving non-adjacent dependencies are relatively difficult to learn and identify, and that difficulty increases as the number of non-adjacent dependencies increases.%
\footnote{%
Compare \citet[][]{vries:2012_processing}.
Of course, whether non-adjacent dependencies are intrinsically difficult depends on the cognitive architecture \citep{udden:2012_implicit}.
There is evidence that monkeys \citep{ravignani:2013_action} and chimpanzees \citep{sonnweber:2015_non} can learn patterns involving one non-adjacent dependency.
