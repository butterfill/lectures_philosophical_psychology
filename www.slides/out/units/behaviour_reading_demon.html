looking behavior) the actions of a human competitor by understanding how an illusory stimulus (grape)
looks to the human.’ \citep{lurz:2011_how}

he does not observe the change in apparent size of the grapes as they are placed inside the
containers, as the chimpanzee does. After the grapes are placed, the competitor enters the room, sits
at the table, looks at each grape through the sides of the containers’

In this case, the subjects (chimps) know which grape is which and how they appear.

infer which is larger from the failed reach of the human competitor)...
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Also a Krachun-like reaching measure:
‘After the competitor has acted in one of these two ways toward the container with the large grape,
the experimenter places opaque coverings completely over each container and moves the platform toward
the chimpanzee. Once the platform is in place before the chimpanzee, the chimpanzee is allowed to
choose one of the two containers (by pointing to it through a finger hole). Since the containers are
covered, the chimpanzee cannot make its choice by seeing the grape or grapes inside the containers.
Rather, to make its preferred choice (which we assume will be the remaining small grape in
competitor-first success trials and the large grape in competitor-first failure trials) the chimpanzee
must attend to the selection process of the competitor.’
