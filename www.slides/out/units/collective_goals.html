<section class="slide"><img src="/img/prosecco_accident.png" width="1024px" class="bkg"/><div class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="notes">Let me first explain something about this notion of a collective goal ...</div><div class="notes">Ayesha takes a glass and holds it up while Beatrice pours prosecco;
unfortunately the prosecco misses the glass and soak Zachs’s trousers.</div><div class="slide"><div class="notes">Here are two sentences, both true:</div><div class="notes show"><p>The tiny drops fell from the bottle. </p></div><p class="step2 indent hide"> - distributive</p><div class="notes show"><p class="em-above">The tiny drops soaked Zach’s trousers. </p></div><p class="step3 indent hide"> - collective</p></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".step2" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">The first sentence is naturally read *distributively*; that is, as specifying something
that each drop did individually.  Perhaps first drop one fell, then another fell.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".step3" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">But the second sentence is naturally read *collectively*.
No one drop soaked Zach’s trousers; rather the soaking was something that the drops
accomplised together.</div><div class="notes">If the sentence is true on this reading, the tiny drops' soaking Zach’s trousers is not
a matter of each drop soaking Zach’s trousers.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what="p:lt(4)" data-css="{&quot;blur&quot;:&quot;2px&quot;}" data-options="{&quot;duration&quot;:500}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">Now consider an example involving actions and their outcomes:</div><p class="em-above notes show">Their thoughtless actions <span class="outcome">soaked Zach’s trousers.</span><span style="margin-left:1em" class="hide causal"> [causal]</span></p></div><div class="slide"><p class="indent">- ambiguous</p><div class="notes">This sentence can be read in two ways, distributively or collectively.
We can imagine that we are talking about a sequence of actions done 
over a period of time, each of which soaked Zach’s trousers.
In this case the outcome, soaking Zach’s trousers, is an outcome of each action.</div><div class="notes">Alternatively we can imagine several actions which have this outcome collectively---as in
our illustration where Ayesha holds a glass while Beatrice pours.
In this case the outcome, soaking Zach’s trousers, is not necessarily an outcome of any of the 
individual actions but it is an outcome of all of them taken together.
That is, it is a collective outcome.</div><div class="notes">(Here I'm ignoring complications associated with the possibility that some
of the actions collectively soaked Zach’s trousers while others did so distributively.)</div><div class="notes">Note that there is a genuine ambiguity here.
To see this, ask yourself how many times Zach’s trousers were soaked.
On the distributive reading they were soaked at least as many times as there are actions.
On the collective reading they were not necessarily soaked more than once.
(On the distributive reading there are several outcomes of the same type and each 
action has a different token outcome of this type; on the collective reading there is a single token 
outcome which is the outcome of two or more actions.)</div><div class="notes">Conclusion so far: two or more actions involving multiple agents can have outcomes 
distributively or collectively.
This is not just a matter of words; there is a difference in the relation between
the actions and the outcome.</div></div><div class="slide"><div class="notes">Now consider one last sentence:</div><div class="notes show"><p class="em-above">The <span class="goal">goal</span><span> of their actions was to fill Zach’s glass.</span><span style="margin-left:1em" class="hide teleological"> [teleological]</span></p></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".causal, .teleological" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">Whereas the previous sentence was causal, and so concened an actual outcome of some actions,
this sentence is teleological, and so concerns an outcome to which actions are directed.</div></div><p class="slide indent">- also ambiguous</p><div class="notes">Like the previous sentence, this sentence has both distributive and collective readings.
On the distributive reading, each of their actions was directed to an outcome,
namely soaking Zach’s trousers.  So there were as many attempts on his trousers as there 
are actions.
On the collective reading, by contrast, it is not necessary that any of the actions
considered individually was directed to this outcome;
rather the actions were collectively directed to this outcome.</div><div class="notes">Conclusion so far: two or more actions involving multiple agents can be collectively
directed to an outcome.</div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".goal" data-cls="transition-04" class="dv dv-addclass"></div><div data-what=".goal" data-cls="bkg-invert" class="dv dv-addclass"></div><div class="notes">Where two or more actions are collectively directed to an outcome, we will say that this 
outcome is a *collective goal* of the actions.
Note two things.
First, this definition involves no assumptions about the intentions or other mental states 
of the agents.  Relatedly, it is the actions rather than the agents which have a collective goal.
Second, a collective goal is just an actual or possible outcome of an action.</div><div class="handout">An outcome is a \emph{collective goal} of two or more actions involving multiple
agents if it is an outcome to which those actions are collectively directed.</div></div>

I think it isn’t ...</div><div class="notes">Suppose two or more agent’s actions are coordinated around an outcome.
That is, their actions are coordinated and they are coordinated in 
such a way that, normally, they would bring about this type of action.</div><div class="notes">When this occurs, it seems to me that the actions are directed to the outcome.
And because this is (in part, at least) a consequence of their coordination,
it is not just that each action is individually directed to the outcome.
So the outcome is one to which their actions are collectively directed.
That is, it is a collective goal of their actions.</div></div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what="img.bkg" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">One consequence of this is that actions can have collective goals of which
the agents may be completely unaware.</div><div class="notes">For example, when two agents between them lift a heavy block by means of each agent pulling on either end of a rope connected to the block via a system of pulleys, their pullings count as coordinated just because the rope relates the force each exerts on the block to the force exerted by the other.  </div><div class="notes">In this  case, the agents' activities are coordinated by a mechanism in their environment, the rope, and not necessarily by any psychological mechanism.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what="img.bkg" data-attr="src" data-value="img/collective_goals/slide60.jpg" class="dv dv-attr"></div><div class="notes">To make a conjecture based on work with bees and ants, in some cases ...</div><div class="notes">the coordination needed for a collective goal may even be supplied by behavioural patterns \citep{seeley2010honeybee}   and  pheromonal signals \citep[pp.\ 178-83, 206-21]{hoelldobler2009superorganism}.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what="img.bkg" data-attr="src" data-value="img/collective_goals/slide62.jpg" class="dv dv-attr"></div><div class="notes">So the definition seems inadequate.
Either it includes things that are not joint actions at all,
or else it captures a notion of joint action that is broader than
the core cases of shared agency that have been of primary interest to 
philosophers.</div><div class="notes">And, to return to the point about cooperation, the bare idea that 
our actions have a collective goal implies nothing about cooperation.</div><div class="notes">\footnote{%
This is not to say that collective goals never involve psychological states.
As we’ll see, one way for several actions to have a collective goal is for their agents to be acting on a shared intention; 
a shared intention supplies the required coordination.
