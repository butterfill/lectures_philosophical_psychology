which is a paradigm case of collective agency,
with a situation where two gangsters walk together but each is forcing the other.
It works like this: Gangster 1 pulls a gun on Gangster 2 and says: “let’s walk”
But Gangster 2 does the same thing to Gangster 1 simultaneously.
This is walking together in the Tarrantino sense,
and clearly not a case of joint action.
At least it’s not joint action unless the central event of of Reservoir Dogs is also a case of joint action.</div></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><img src="/img/slide11.jpg" width="1024px" style="" class="bkg"/><div style="" class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><div class="notes">Since in this case there is something which all the agents involved intend,

that the same diagnosis applies: cooperation is missing. 
Although Bratman isn’t 100% clear about this, his sufficient conditions for shared intention
require no more in the way of cooperation than the Simple View does.%
\footnote{
Bratman initially \citet[pp.~336--7{Bratman:1992mi} argued that actions can involve 
shared agency without any of the agents being disposed or committed to 
support the others; and he takes this to imply that shared agency does 
not necessarily involve cooperation (see footnote 18, ibid).  However, 
in a more recent discussion Bratman claims (incorrectly, in my view) 
that, on his view of shared 
intention, agents’ having a shared intention puts them ‘under rational 
pres­sure to be willing to some extent to help [each other] if need be’ 
(\citealp[p.~56]{bratman:2014_book}; see also footnote 38).

First, it's a technical term: on many accounts, neither shared intentions are shared not intentions.
Second, I think everyone will agree that shared intention features alongside 
ordinary, individual intention in practical reasoning; so that the two are 
inferrentially integrated.
Third, I take it that shared intention is suppose to stand to joint action 
roughly as ordinary, individual intention stands to ordinary, individual action ...</div><div class="notes">Beyond this these is much disagreement.
Some hold that understanding it requires postulating novel kinds of 
attitude (\citealp{Searle:1990em}), or novel kinds of subject, namely 
group \citep{helm_plural_2008} or plural subjects \citep{schmid:2009_plural_bk}, 
or novel kinds of reasoning \citep{Gold:2007zd}, or novel kinds of 
commitment  (\citealp{Gilbert:1992rs}), or yet further kinds of 
novelty \citep[e.g.][]{Roth:2004ki,gallotti:2013_social}. The 
existence of so many fundamentally conflicting approaches underlines the 
difficulty of understanding shared intention.</div><div class="notes">I want to suggest that this difficulty motivates re-considering the Simple View.
Of course the Simple View is wrong as it stands.
But maybe the way to fix it is not to add extra layers of intention
or mess with the ontology; maybe reflection on more basic representations and
processes involved in acting together will provide a way to understand joint action,
one that requires no more intending than is involved in the Simple View.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".shared-intention" data-css="{&quot;text-decoration&quot;:&quot;line-through&quot;}" class="dv dv-style"></div><div data-what=".question-mark" data-css="{&quot;color&quot;:&quot;#900000&quot;}" data-options="{&quot;duration&quot;:500}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">That, anyway, is what I aim to argue in this talk.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><img src="/img/corrado_bkg.jpg" width="1024px" style="" class="bkg"/><div style="" class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div data-what="img.bkg" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:0}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;hidden&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:0}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">In what follows I will pursue an alternative, minimal strategy
