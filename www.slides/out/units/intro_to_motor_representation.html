their action-coordinating role.</div><div class="slide"><div data-what="img.bkg" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">Suppose you are a cook who needs to take an egg from its box, crack it and put it (except for the shell) into a bowl ready for beating into a carbonara sauce.  
Even for such mundane, routine actions, the constraints on adequate performance can vary significantly depending on subtle variations in context. For example, the position of a hot pan may require altering the trajectory along which the egg is transported, or time pressures may mean that the action must be performed unusually swiftly on this occasion.
Further, many of the constraints on performance involve relations between actions occurring at different times.
To illustrate, how tightly you need to grip the egg now depends, among other things, on the forces to which you will subject the egg in lifting it later.
It turns out that people reliably grip objects such as eggs just tightly enough across a range of conditions in which the optimal tightness of grip varies.
This indicates (along with much other evidence) that information about the cook’s anticipated future hand and arm movements appropriately influences how tightly she initially grips the egg (compare \citealp{kawato:1999_internal}).
This anticipatory control of grasp, 
like several other features of action performance (\citealp[see][chapter 1]{rosenbaum:2010_human} for more examples),
is not plausibly a consequence of mindless physiology, nor of intention and practical reasoning.
This is one reason for postulating motor representations, which characteristically play a role in coordinating sequences of very small scale actions such as grasping an egg in order to lift it.</div><div class="notes">The scale of an actual action can be defined in terms of means-end relations.  
Given two actions which are related as means to ends by the processes and representations 
involved in their performance, the first is smaller in scale than the second just if the 
first is a means to the second.  Generalising, we associate the scale of an actual action 
with the depth of the hierarchy of outcomes that are related to it by the transitive closure 
of the means-ends relation.  Then, generalising further, a repeatable action (something that 
different agents might do independently on several occasions) is associated with a scale 
characteristic of the things people do when they perform that action.  Given that actions 
such as cooking a meal or painting a house count as small-scale actions, actions such as 
grasping an egg or dipping a brush into a can of paint are very-small scale.  Note that we 
do not stipulate a tight link between the very small scale and the motoric.  In some cases 
intentions may play a role in coordinating sequences of very small scale purposive actions, 
and in some cases motor representations may concern actions which are not very small scale.  
The claim we wish to consider is only that, often enough, explaining the coordination of 
sequences of very small scale actions appears to involve representations but not, or not 
only, intentions.  To a first approximation, \emph{motor representation} is a label for 
such representations.%
\footnote{% 
Much more to be said about what motor representations are; for instance, see \citet{butterfill:2012_intention} for the view that motor representations can be distinguished by representational format.

An initially attractive, conservative 
view would be that they represent bodily configurations and joint displacements, 
or perhaps sequences of these, only.
However there is now a significant body of evidence that some motor representations 
do not specify particular sequences of bodily configurations and joint displacements, 
but rather represent outcomes such as the grasping of an egg or the pressing of a switch.  
These are outcomes which might, on different occasions, involve very different bodily 
configurations and joint displacements
(see \citealp{rizzolatti_functional_2010} for a selective review).</div><div class="notes">Such outcomes are abstract relative to bodily configurations and joint displacements 
in that there are many different ways of achieving them.</div><div class="notes">But how do we know that motor representations carry information about such outcomes?
I’m glad you asked, let me explain ...</div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><img src="/img/carry_information/Slide1.jpg" class="bkg"/><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><div data-what="img.bkg" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:0}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;hidden&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:0}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="grid_6 words left-half"><div style="padding-right:1em;"><p>Markers of motor representation <span class="step2 hide"> ...</span></p><div class="notes">The experiments providing such evidence typically involve a marker of motor representation, 
such as a pattern of neuronal firings, a motor evoked potential or a behavioural performance 
profile, which, in controlled settings, allows sameness or difference of motor representation 
to be distinguished.  Such markers can be exploited to show that the sameness and difference 
of motor representation is linked to the sameness and difference of an outcome such as the 
grasping of a particular object.
