is one reason for doing so.]</div><div class="slide"><div data-what="img.bkg" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">Suppose you are a cook who needs to take an egg from its box, crack it and put it (except for the
shell) into a bowl ready for beating into a carbonara sauce.
Even for such mundane, routine actions, the constraints on adequate performance can vary
significantly depending on subtle variations in context. For example, the position of a hot pan
may require altering the trajectory along which the egg is transported, or time pressures may mean
that the action must be performed unusually swiftly on this occasion.
Further, many of the constraints on performance involve relations between actions occurring at
different times.
To illustrate, how tightly you need to grip the egg now depends, among other things, on the forces
to which you will subject the egg in lifting it later.
It turns out that people reliably grip objects such as eggs just tightly enough across a range of
conditions in which the optimal tightness of grip varies.
This indicates (along with much other evidence) that information about the cook’s anticipated
future hand and arm movements appropriately influences how tightly she initially grips the egg
(compare \citealp{kawato:1999_internal}).
This anticipatory control of grasp, 
like several other features of action performance (\citealp[see][chapter 1]{rosenbaum:2010_human} for more examples),
is not plausibly a consequence of mindless physiology, nor of intention and practical reasoning.
This is one reason for postulating motor representations, which characteristically play a role in
coordinating sequences of very small scale actions such as grasping an egg in order to lift it.</div><div class="notes">[The scale of an actual action can be defined in terms of means-end relations.  
Given two actions which are related as means to ends by the processes and representations 
involved in their performance, the first is smaller in scale than the second just if the 
first is a means to the second.  Generalising, we associate the scale of an actual action 
with the depth of the hierarchy of outcomes that are related to it by the transitive closure 
of the means-ends relation.  Then, generalising further, a repeatable action (something that 
different agents might do independently on several occasions) is associated with a scale 
characteristic of the things people do when they perform that action.  Given that actions 
such as cooking a meal or painting a house count as small-scale actions, actions such as 
grasping an egg or dipping a brush into a can of paint are very-small scale.  Note that we 
do not stipulate a tight link between the very small scale and the motoric.  In some cases 
intentions may play a role in coordinating sequences of very small scale purposive actions, 
and in some cases motor representations may concern actions which are not very small scale.  
The claim we wish to consider is only that, often enough, explaining the coordination of 
sequences of very small scale actions appears to involve representations but not, or not 
only, intentions.  To a first approximation, \emph{motor representation} is a label for 
such representations.%

Much more to be said about what motor representations are; for instance, see \citet{butterfill:2012_intention} for the view that motor representations can be distinguished by representational format.

representations.’</div><div class="notes">‘They are internal models or stored representations that represent generic knowledge
about a certain pattern of action and are implicated in the production and control of
action. For instance, in the influential Motor Schema Theory proposed by Richard Schmidt
(1975, 2003), a motor schema involves a generalized motor program, together with corre-
sponding ‘recall’ and ‘recognition’ schemas. The generalized motor program is thought to
contain an abstract representation defining the general form or pattern of an action,
that is the organization and structure common to a set of motor acts (e.g., invariant
features pertaining to the order of events, their spatial configuration, their relative
timing and the relative force with which they are produced). This generalized motor
program has parameters that control it. In order to determine how an action should be
performed on a given occasion, parameter values adapted to the situation must be
specified. Thus, a motor schema also includes a rule or system of rules describing the
relationships between initial conditions, parameter values and outcomes and allowing us
to perform the action over a large range of conditions (the ‘recall schema’ in Schmidt’s
terminology). Finally, the motor schema also includes a rule or system of rules
describing the relationships between initial conditions, exteroceptive and propri-
oceptive sensory feedback during an action, and action outcome (a recognition sche- ma),
allowing agents to know when they have made an error – i.e., the action does not have
the sensory consequences it is expected to have – and to correct for it.’</div><div class="notes">Are motor schemas an alterantive to motor representations? Tempting to think that where
they talk about motor schema, we think of motor representations that represent outcomes
that are relatively distal from action (e.g. are affector-neutral).</div><div class="notes">This would explain why they contrast motor schema with motor programmes. We use ‘motor
representation’ to include both.</div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><img src="/img/motor_representation_fig/Slide02.jpg" width="1024px" style="" class="bkg"/><div style="" class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="notes">A goal represented motorically triggers a process which, via computations of things
