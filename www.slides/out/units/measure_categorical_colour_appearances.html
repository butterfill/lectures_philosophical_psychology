speakers (who have words for green and blue) with native Tarahumara (a Uto-Aztecan language of 
northern Mexico) speakers, whose basic colour words mark no such distinction.</div><div class="notes">Here you see a triad of colours, A, B and C.
Kay and Kempton first measured ‘discrimination distance’.
That is, how far apart are each of these in terms of JNDs?
As it turns out, JNDs are not affected by which categorical colour properties you can name
\citep{witzel:2013_categorical}.
So we would expect discrimination distance to be approximately the same for all 
participants. (Some studies do measure discrimination distance for
each subject individually and find indiviudal differences; e.g. \citep{witzel:2014_categorical}).
In this case, you can see that A is further from B in JNDs than B is from C.</div><div class="notes">‘discrimination distance’:
‘The scale of psychological distance between colors we take as the "real" scale
for present pur- poses is called discrimination distance. The unit of this
scale is the just noticeable dif- ference (jnd), that is, the smallest physical
difference in wavelength that can be detected by the human eye.’
\citep[p.~68]{kay_what_1984}</div><div class="notes">Next Kay and Kempton measured how visually similar their subjects judged these
samples to be.
To do this, they showed them different triads of colours and asked them,
Which is the most different from the other two?
For each pair they then computed the proportion of times that pair was split.
(As they write: ‘The psychological distance between A and B relative to other
stimulus pairs in the set is given by the proportion of times A and B are split
by the subject's selection of one of them as the most different item in the
triad.’ p. 70.)
This is what you see from the Tarahumara speakers and the English speakers
under the circles.</div><div class="notes">Looking at the numbers, you can see that 
the English speakers tended to split B and C more often than A and B, 
whereas the Tarahumara speakers did the opposite.</div><div class="notes">And note that the B-C pair crosses the blue-green boundary.
What does this mean?
‘The presence of the blue-green lexical category boundary appears to cause
speakers of English to exaggerate the subjective distances of colors close to
this boundary. Tarahumara, which does not lexicalize the blue-green contrast,
does not show this distorting effect.’</div><div class="notes">\citep[p.~77]{kay_what_1984}:
‘the English speaker judges chip B to be more similar to A than to C because
the blue-green boundary passes between B and C, even though B is perceptually
closer to C than to A.’</div><div class="notes">This is exactly the sort of evidence that should persuade us

%*NB: second approach (and third approach = perceptual grouping) matters
because you might say that the things do appear differently, just in a
way that we are unaware of. Unawareness of the difference less plausibly

what does the difference in appearance affect?</div><div class="notes">How can we defend the view that red things differ in visual appearance from non-red things?
You could insist that the difference in appearance is not manifest in this particular case.
Perhaps, for example, because the slider people used to ajust the middle sample changed 
its hue, subjects attended to hue and ignored other features of the colour.
(There’s no evidence for this speculation and subjects were not asked about the hue.)</div><div class="notes">Are there other objections?</div><div class="notes">Could you object that the difference in appearance between red and non-red things
is already built into the metric used for the colour space?  In that case you would not
expect additional effects of categorical colour property on appearance. These effects would be
already taken into account in the measurements of similarity.</div><div class="notes">To answer this objection we need to note that there are multiple ways of 
measuring perceptual similarity.
In this case, the researchers used JNDs.
They have previously shown that category boundaries (as specified by an individual 
subject’s colour words) do not affect JNDs.  That is, JNDs are not generally smaller at the
category boundaries \citep{witzel:2013_categorical}.
But when you take pairs of colours that are, say, 3 JNDs apart, then whether or not 
the pair straddles a category boundary will affect speed and accuracy of discimination
\citep{witzel:2014_categorical}.
So we can be confident that using JNDs to measure perceptual similarity does not
take into account differences in the ways categorical colour propreties appear.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".methods .second" data-cls="bkg-grey-row " class="dv dv-removeclass"></div><div data-what=".methods .third" data-cls="bkg-grey-row " class="dv dv-addclass"></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><img src="/img/webster_2012_fig1.png" style=""/></div></div></div></div><div style="position: absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%;"></div><div class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><p class="source">Webster & Kay 2012, figure 1</p></div></div></div><div class="notes">Converging evidence that things labelled with different basic colour terms
do not thereby differ in visual appearance involves a third method for
detecting visual appearances (\citealp{webster:2012_color}). The idea, as
illustrated in Figure \vref{fig:perceptual_grouping}, is that how things
appear with respect to colour should influence how likely it is that they
will be grouped together perceptually. The results are consistent with the
view that whether objects are labelled with the same basic colour term
makes no measurable difference to how they are grouped perceptually. This
further supports suspicion that properties denoted by colour terms like
‘red’ make no difference to visual appearances (see also
\citealp{davidoff:2012_perceptual}).</div><div class="notes">Let’s consider the experiment in more detail.

group the diagonal as a line, like / or \.</div><div class="notes">Subjects’ task was indeed to judge which way the diagonal went.
\citet{webster:2012_color} varied the center colour to find at what point
a given subject was equally like to judge that the line was / or \.
Call this the ‘grouping midpoint colour’.
(p. 378: ‘Observers made a two-alternative forced choice response to indicate
whether the perceived orientation was clockwise or counterclockwise. A
staircase varied the center color angle to estimate the an- gle at which
both orientations appeared equally likely, with the point of subjective
equality estimated from the mean of the final 10 of 13 reversals in the
staircase.’)</div></section><section class="slide"><div class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div style="position:relative;"><img src="/img/webster_2012_fig2.png" style="clip: auto; position: absolute; max-width:720px; max-height:550px;"/></div><p class="source">Webster & Kay 2002, figure 2</p><div class="notes">\citet{webster:2012_color} reasoned like this:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Where the two diagonals are from within the same colour category,
the grouping midpoint colour should be the midpoint in a colour space that
represents retinal colour discrimination.
\item Where the two diagonals are from different colour categories (one is 
green, the other is blue), and one of the diagonals is just over a boundary,
then the grouping midpoint colour should be closer to the colour of the diagonal
that is just over the boundary in a colour space that
represents retinal colour discrimination.
\end{enumerate}</div><div class="notes">This prediction is illustrated in the figure.
The dotted line shows the prediction if there is no effect of colour category
on perceptual grouping; the solid lines show different strengths of effect.</div><div class="notes">They found that almost no indicators of an
effect of colour category on perceptual grouping
(there are a variety of measures and one was signifiant: 
p. 381: ‘the participants’ settings thus trended toward a (very weak) CP effect,
with an average bias of 0.10 (which was nevertheless significantly differ-
ent from zero; t (7) = 3.73, p < .01).’).
They also suggested that these effects may be due to the use of 
CIELAB as a colour space
(p. 382: ‘ the small biases we found in the observer’s settings may in part
include an artifact of the stimulus space, weakening further the evidence for a
clear CP effect in the grouping task.’)</div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><p class="center">hue scaling</p><p class="em-above">‘observers are typically shown a set

an effect across the blue-green category boundary.
Roughly speaking, native English speakers’ tendancy to say how much 
green or blue is in a colour cannot be predicted by its position in a 
cone-opponent colour space (one based on retinal colour processing)
but also appears to be influenced by categories.
(p. 385: ‘The prediction for the average curve ... indicates a CP bias of
0.23 across the blue–green boundary. This ... underestimates the degree of
bias in individual observer’s settings, which spanned a very wide range
from 0.02 to 0.92 with a mean of 0.35 ... The distribution of categorical
biases in the hue settings is substantially different from 0 (t (58) =
15.79, p < 0.0001).’)</div><div class="notes">I don’t think this is very informative for two reasons.
First, it seems to me that hue scaling could be influenced by tendancies to
label a colour. The judgements aren’t obviously a reflection of how things
appear.</div><div class="notes">Second, colour discrimination may not be well controlled in this study.
(There are also issues about the blue-green boundary: the effects could in
principle be due to the fact that the boundary ‘falls close to the L pole
of the LvsM axis of cone-opponent space (Malkoc et al., 2005)’
\citep[p.~388]{webster:2012_color} .)</div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><img src="/img/categorical_colour_difference3.jpg" class="bkg"/><div class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="methods"><p style="margin-top:350px;" class="title">Methods</p><p class="indent hem-around first">1.
