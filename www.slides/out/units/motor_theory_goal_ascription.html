          <div class="notes">Two forms of goal ascription, representational and functional (\citealp{gallese:2011_what}).
In \emph{representational goal ascription}, three things must be represented: an action, an outcome and the relation between this outcome and the action in virtue of which the outcome is a goal of the action.
% jacob:2012_sharing: ‘Ascribing a goal to an agent consists in forming a belief (or judgment) about an agent that he or she has a goal or is performing some goal-directed action.’
In \emph{functional goal ascription}, the relation between action and outcome is captured without being represented.
To say that this relation is \emph{captured} is to say that there is a process which ensures that the outcome represented is a goal of the action.

            <div class="notes">Motor representations cannot suffice for representational goal ascription. 
It is true that, in someone observing an action there can be motor representations of outcomes which, non accidentally, are the goals of the observed action.
But this is not enough.
There would have to be, in addition, a motor representation of an intention, or of a motor representation or of some other goal-state, or of a function. 
But there are no such motor representations.

          <p>Why are outcomes you represent motorically often among the goals of your actions?</p>
          <div class="notes">How does it ever come about that an outcome represented motorically in observing an action is an outcome to which that action is directed?
First consider a parallel question about performing rather than observing actions.
Suppose you are alone and not observing or imagining any other actions.
When performing actions in this situation, outcomes represented motorically in you will normally be
among the goals of your actions; that is, they will be outcomes to which your actions are directed.
What ensures this correspondence between outcomes represented and goals?

          <div class="slide">
            <p>Because planning-like processes.</p>
            <div class="notes">It is the role of the
representation in controlling how the action unfolds. Representations of outcomes trigger
planning-like motor processes whose function is to cause actions that will bring about the outcomes
represented \citep{miall:1996_forward,arbib:1985_coordinated,rosenbaum:2012_cognition}.

            <p>Because planning-like processes.</p>
            <div class="notes">The answer, we suggest, is roughly that planning-like processes can be used not only to control
actions but also to predict them.
Let us explain.

        <p class="source">Sinigalia & Butterfill 2015, figure 1</p>
        <div class="notes">There is evidence that a motor representation of an outcome can cause a determination of which movements are likely to be performed to achieve that outcome \citep[see, for instance,][]{kilner:2004_motor, urgesi:2010_simulating}. Further, the processes involved in determining how observed actions are likely to unfold given their outcomes are closely related, or identical, to processes involved in performing actions. 
This is known in part thanks to studies of how observing actions can facilitate performing actions congruent with those observed, and can interfere with performing incongruent actions \citep{
	brass:2000_compatibility, 
	craighero:2002_hand, 
	kilner:2003_interference, 
	costantini:2012_does}. 
Planning-like processes in action observation have also been demonstrated by measuring observers' predictive gaze.  If you were to observe just the early phases of a grasping movement, your eyes might jump to its likely target, ignoring nearby objects \citep{ambrosini:2011_grasping}. These proactive eye movements resemble those you would typically make if you were acting yourself \citep{Flanagan:2003lm}. 
Importantly, the occurrence of such proactive eye movements in action observation depends on your
representing the outcome of an action motorically; even temporary interference in the observer's
motor abilities will interfere with the eye movements \citep{Costantini:2012fk}.
These proactive eye movements also depend on planning-like processes; requiring the observer to
perform actions incongruent with those she is observing can eliminate proactive eye movements
\citep{Costantini:2012uq}. This, then, is further evidence for planning-like motor processes in
action observation.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">So observers represent outcomes motorically and these representations trigger planning-like processes
which generate expectations about how the observed actions will unfold and their sensory consequences.
Now the mere occurrence of these processes is not sufficient to explain why, in action observation,
an outcome represented motorically is likely to be an outcome to which the observed action is
directed.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">To take a tiny step further, we conjecture that, in action observation, \textbf{motor representations of
outcomes are weakened to the extent that the expectations they generate are unmet}
\citep[compare][]{Fogassi:2005nf}.
A motor representation of an outcome to which an observed action is not directed is likely to
generate incorrect expectations about how this action will unfold, and failures of these
expectations to be met will weaken the representation.
This is what ensures that there is a correspondence between outcomes represented motorically in
observing actions and the goals of those actions.
