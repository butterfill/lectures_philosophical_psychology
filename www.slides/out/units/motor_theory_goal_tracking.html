    <title>The Motor Theory of Goal Tracking | Philosophical Psychology</title>
    <meta name="description" content="How do infants (and adults) track the goals of others’ actions?
According to the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking, it is sometimes* by 
means of motor processes.
More carefully, the Motor Theory of Goal Tracking consists of these claims: 
(1) in action observation, possible outcomes of observed actions are represented motorically;
(2) these representations trigger motor processes much as if the observer were performing actions
directed to the outcomes;
(3) such processes generates predictions;
(4) a triggering representation is weakened if the predictions it generates fail.
The result is that, often enough, the only only outcomes to which the observed action is a means
are represented strongly.

Infants’ pure goal-tracking depends on the double life of motor processes.

<div class="handout">According to the \emph{Motor Theory of Goal Tracking}, infants (and adults) sometimes track the
goals of others’ by means of motor processes \citep[see][for details]{sinigaglia:2015_puzzle}.
</div>
<div class="handout">More carefully  the \emph{Motor Theory of Goal Tracking} states that: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item in action observation, possible outcomes of observed actions are represented motorically;
\item these representations trigger motor processes much as if the observer were performing actions directed to the outcomes;

          <p class="center">The Double Life of Motor Representation</p>
          <div class="notes">Suppose you are reaching for, grasping, transporting and then placing a pen. Performing even
relatively simple action sequences like this involves satisfying many constraints that cannot
normally be satisfied by explicit practical reasoning, especially if performance is to be rapid and
fluent. Rather, such performances require motor representations.
These representations are paradigmatically involved in preparing, executing and monitoring actions.%
\footnote{%
See \citet{wolpert:1995internal, miall:1996_forward, jeannerod:1998nbo, zhang:2007_planning}.
Note that motor representations sometimes occur in an agent who has prepared an action and is required (as it turns out) not to perform it: although she has prevented herself from acting, motor representations specifying the action persist, perhaps because they are necessary for monitoring whether prevention has succeeded \citep{bonini:2014_ventral}.
}
But they also live a double life. Motor representations concerning a particular type of action are
involved not only in performing an action of that type but also sometimes in observing one. That is,
if you were to observe Ayesha reach for, grasp, transport and then place a pen, motor representations
would occur in you much like those that would also occur in you if it were you---not Ayesha---who was
doing this.

but I won’t mention any of that here.

The idea is that pure goal-tracking involves motor processes rather than thinking
and reasoning about goals.

            <div class="notes">At this point it is helpful to think about speech.
To utter a phoneme is to produce complex coordinated movements of the 
lips, larynx, tongue and velum.
Further, how these should be moved and what sound should be produced depends on
many factors including phonemic context, rate of speech and prosody.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">So uttering a phoneme is unlike pressing a key on a piano keyboard:
it not a matter of producing a particular sound
but of performing a complex, goal-directed action.

        <div class="notes">Goal-tracking is acting in reverse.
-- in action observation, possible outcomes of observed actions are represented
-- these representations trigger planning as if performing actions directed to the outcomes
-- such planning generates predictions
-- a triggering representation is weakened if its predictions fail
The result is that the only only outcomes to which the observed action is a means
are represented strongly.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">There is evidence that a motor representation of an outcome can cause a determination of which
movements are likely to be performed to achieve that outcome \citep[see, for
instance,][]{kilner:2004_motor, urgesi:2010_simulating}. Further, the processes involved in
determining how observed actions are likely to unfold given their outcomes are closely related,
or identical, to processes involved in performing actions.
This is known in part thanks to studies of how observing actions can facilitate performing
actions congruent with those observed, and can interfere with performing incongruent actions
\citep{
	brass:2000_compatibility, 
	craighero:2002_hand, 
	kilner:2003_interference, 
	costantini:2012_does}. 
Planning-like processes in action observation have also been demonstrated by measuring observers' predictive gaze.  If you were to observe just the early phases of a grasping movement, your eyes might jump to its likely target, ignoring nearby objects \citep{ambrosini:2011_grasping}. These proactive eye movements resemble those you would typically make if you were acting yourself \citep{Flanagan:2003lm}. 
Importantly, the occurrence of such proactive eye movements in action observation depends on your
representing the outcome of an action motorically; even temporary interference in the observer's
motor abilities will interfere with the eye movements \citep{Costantini:2012fk}.
These proactive eye movements also depend on planning-like processes; requiring the observer to
perform actions incongruent with those she is observing can eliminate proactive eye movements
\citep{Costantini:2012uq}. This, then, is further evidence for planning-like motor processes in
action observation.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">So observers represent outcomes motorically and these representations trigger planning-like processes
which generate expectations about how the observed actions will unfold and their sensory consequences.
Now the mere occurrence of these processes is not sufficient to explain why, in action observation,
an outcome represented motorically is likely to be an outcome to which the observed action is
directed.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">To take a tiny step further, we conjecture that, in action observation, \textbf{motor representations of
outcomes are weakened to the extent that the expectations they generate are unmet}
\citep[compare][]{Fogassi:2005nf}.
A motor representation of an outcome to which an observed action is not directed is likely to
generate incorrect expectations about how this action will unfold, and failures of these
expectations to be met will weaken the representation.
This is what ensures that there is a correspondence between outcomes represented motorically in
observing actions and the goals of those actions.

It looks like, in endorsing mTgt, we are postulating a discrepancy between goal-tracking and
theory of mind abilities, since theory of mind abilities are perhaps unlikely to depend on motor
processes in the way in which goal-tracking does. 
However, we should probably be cautious here; in pilot research with Jason Low, we have some
preliminary evidence that some theory of mind abilities may be more closely tied to motor processes
than anyone has yet imagined.
