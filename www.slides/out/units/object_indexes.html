These object indexes can be thought of, roughly, as mental analogues of the
pins that an old fashioned logistician sticks into a map in keeping track of
supply trucks.
When things go well, the movements of trucks on the ground are mirrored by
the movements of pins on the map.
The key characteristic of the pins is this: ignoring re-use, if you have
the same pin at two times, then the trucks it points to at those times are
one and the same truck."/>

a system of object indexes has been challenged.  
See \citet[p.\ 59]{scholl:2009_what}:
\begin{quote}
`I suggest that what Pylyshyn’s (2004) experiments show is exactly what they intuitively 
seem to show: We can keep track of the targets in MOT, but not which one is which. 
[...]
all of this seems easily explained [...] by the view 
that MOT is simply realized by split object-based attention to the MOT targets as a set.'
\end{quote}
It is surely right that the existence of MOT does not, all by itself,
provide support for the existence of a system of object indexes.
However, contra what Scholl seems to be suggesting here, the MOT paradigm 
can be adapated to provide such evidence.
Thus, for instance, \citet{horowitz:2010_direction} show that, in a MOT paradigm, observers 
can report the direction of one or two targets without advance knowledge of which 
targets' directions they will be asked to report.)

Your task is to say whether this letter is one of the letters that appeared at the start or whether it is a new letter.
Consider just those cases in which the answer is yes: the letter at the end is one of those which you saw at the start.
Of interest is how long this takes you to respond in two cases: when the letter appears on the same object at the start and end, and, in contrast, when the letter appears on one object at the start and a different object at the end.
It turns out that most people can answer the question more quickly in the first case.
That is, they are faster when a letter appears on the same object twice than when it appears on two different objects 
\citep{Kahneman:1992xt}.
This difference in response times is the

\emph{object-specific preview benefit}.
Its existence shows that, in this task, you are keeping track of which object is which as they move.
This is why the existence of an object-specific preview benefit is taken to be evidence that object indexes exist.

a patterned square disappears behind the barrier; later a plain black ring emerges.  
If you consider speed and direction only, these movements are consistent with there being just one object.
But given the distinct shapes and textures of these things, it seems all but certain that there must be two objects.
Yet in many cases these two objects will be assigned the same object index \citep{flombaum:2006_temporal,mitroff:2007_space}.
So one signature limit of systems of object indexes is that information about speed and distance can override information about shape and texture.

return to the old-fashioned logistician who is keeping track of supply trucks.
In doing this she has only quite limited information to go on.
She receives sporadic reports that a supply truck has been sighted at one or another location.
But these reports do not specify which supply truck is at that location.
She must therefore work out which pin to move to the newly reported location.
In doing this she might rely on assumptions about the trucks’ movements being constrained to trace continuous paths, and about the direction and speed of the trucks typically remaining constant.
These assumptions allow her to use the sporadic reports that some truck or other is there in forming views about the routes a particular truck has taken.
A system of object indexes faces the same problem when the indexed objects are not continuously perceptible.
What assumptions or principles are used to determine whether this object at time $t_1$ and that object at time $t_2$ have the same object index pinned to them?

        <div class="notes">Suppose object indexes are being used in tracking four or more objects simultaneously and one of these objects—call it the \emph{first object}—disappears behind a barrier.
Later two objects appear from behind the barrier, one on the far side of the barrier (call this the \emph{far object}) and one close to the point where the object disappeared (call this the \emph{near object}).
If the system of object indexes relies on assumptions about speed and direction of movement, then the first object and the far object should be assigned the same object index.
But this is not what typically happens.
Instead it is likely that the first object and the near object are assigned the same object index.%
\footnote{
See \citet{franconeri:2012_simple}.  Note that this corrects an earlier argument for a contrary view \citep{scholl:1999_tracking}.
}
If this were what always happened, then we could not fully explain how infants represent objects as persisting by appeal to object indexes because, at least in some cases, infants do use assumptions about speed and direction in interpolating the locations of briefly unperceived objects.
There would be a discrepancy between the Principles of Object Perception which characterise how infants represent objects as persisting and the principles that describe how object indexes work.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">But this is not the whole story about object indexes.
It turns out that object indexes behave differently when just one object is being tracked and the object-specific preview benefit is used to detect them.
In this case it seems that assumptions about continuity and constancy in speed and direction do play a role in determining whether an object at $t_1$ and an object at $t_2$ are assigned the same object indexes \citep{flombaum:2006_temporal,mitroff:2007_space}.
In the terms introduced in the previous paragraph, in this case where just one object is being tracked, the first object and the far object are assigned the same object index.
This suggests that the principles which govern object indexes may match the principles which characterise how infants represent objects as persisting.
