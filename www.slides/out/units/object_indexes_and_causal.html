          <p>How to get beyond intuition?</p>
          <p>The launching effect: detecting a 50ms difference in the delay between two movements.</p>
          <div class="notes">Part of the answer is this.  We don't worry about the content of the verbal reports.
We just focus on the fact that their content changes depending on a tiny, 50 millisecond
difference in the delay between two movements.
Call this \emph{launching effect}.

          <div class="notes">This doesn't tell us what people are detecting.
But it does tell us that the effect is not merely confabulation or making it up.
So we have taken a tiny step beyond intuition.  But we also have to answer two questions.

It's reasonably obvious that object indexes require segmentation (otherwise how would they
attach to *objects*), and the evidence that they can survive occlusion is relatively easy to
understand.  But the point that having object indexes involves tracking causal interactions
is less straightforward.  So let's consider that ...

        <div class="notes">Object indexes are linked to causation.
In order to track objects, a perceptual system has to be sensitive to be causal interactions
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Why is this true?
Because when you have a causal interaction, there's a conflict between principles of object 
perception e.g. distinct surfaces=>two objects, vs good continuity of motion=>one object
The perceptual system needs to know when conflicts should be reconciled and when they should 
be written off.
We get perceptual effects of causal interactions when there are conflicts among cues of object 
identity.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">This is a point Michotte made.  He found that launching occurs when there is a conflict between 
cues to object identity: good continuity of movement suggests a single object whereas the 
existence of two distinct surfaces indicates two objects.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">It is plausible that other types of causal interaction also involve conflicts between cues 
to object identity.

in launching but not in various spatio-temporally similar sequences.  Since the object-specific

sequences, features of the second object (such as motion) remain bound to the first object for 
a short time after the second object starts to move.

But (A) note the questions in the commentary; and (B) Hubbard on Kiritani (1999)
for launching when the contact is occluded; and context effects (Scholl on postdiction)
and (D) evidence for effects of 
acoustic stimuli on launching, suggesting that the effect may not be modality-specific
(The evidence on this point is controversial. Sekuler and colleagues show that when subjects observe
an ambiguous visual display consistent with either a collision or a passing event, the timing of a
tone can control whether subjects report seeing a collision or pass- ing, and argue that this is a
multisensory phenomenon: R. Sekuler et al., ‘Sound Alters Visual Motion Perception’, Nature, 
(), p. . Watanabe and Shimojo extend this finding by showing that not any event (or
non-event) which draws attention at the moment of a collision will disambiguate the display; they
argue that the tone’s effect on the perception of a col- lision is a ‘genuine audiovisual effect,
not an audiovisual effect that results from auditory effects’: K. Watanabe and S. Shimojo, ‘When
Sound Affects Vision: Effects of Auditory Grouping on Visual Motion Perception’, Psychological
Science,  (), pp. –. Guski and Troje, on the other hand, show that features which carry
no information about causation, such as a blink, can also influence whether subjects report seeing a
collision or a passing. These authors conclude that auditory influences on the perceptual of
collisions are ‘no true cross-modal phenomenon’: R. Guski and N.F. Troje, ‘Audiovisual Phenomenal
Causality’, Perception and Psychophysics,  (), pp. –, at p. .)

          <div class="notes">Schlottmann and Shanks (1992, Experiment 2) ... The point of this
experiment was to distinguish between cues to causality provided by
perceptual features within a display (launching vs. delay) and by
statistical contingencies (between Object A moving and Object B moving) as
observed across trials. If Michotte’s hypothesis is correct, statistical
contingencies should not affect perceptual judgments of whether a
launching has occurred. Conversely, perceptual features should not affect
judgments of whether A’s movement is statistically necessary for B’s
movement.  ... The results of the study were clear cut ...: Launching versus delay
affected ratings of how convincing the collisions looked but not ratings of
necessity. However, the presence of a predictive statistical relation
affected ratings of necessity but not ratings of convincingness. These
results are consistent with Michotte’s hypothesis: Statistical
contingencies over trials do not affect the cause detector on the right of
Figure 3A, which is sensitive only to purely spatio-temporal properties of
the individual displays.

          <div class="notes">Schlottman & Shanks (1992, p. 340): 
‘Despite the fact that a colour change of Object B more reliably predicted B’s movement than did the
impact of Object A, where was no impact of the predictive relationship on subjects’ ratings of
perceived causality. In other experiments asking subjects to make causal judgements, however, such
alternative predictive signals are known to reduce subjects’ ratings dramatically (Shanks, 1986).’

Roser, Fugelsang, Dunbar, Corballis, and Gazzaniga (2005), who tested two

launching sequence from the others only if their right hemisphere processed
the event. By contrast, the same patients were able to solve a causal
reasoning problem—figuring out which of two switches controlled a
light—only if the problem appeared to their left hemisphere.’

So it can't be a consequence of thinking about the interaction.
Still, it might be a consequence of perceiving objects in certain relations to each other.
However a key finding shows that this is wrong.
Surprisingly, we don't first perceive objects and then get the launching effect;
rather, the launching effect is tied up with perceptual process of identifying objects' surfaces.

As I said,
normally, if the two balls overlap completely, subjects report seeing a single object

But if we show subjects a sequence like the launching effect but where the first square 
overlaps the second's position before it moves.  When this event is shown is isolation 
almost all subjects see it as a single object changing colour.  But when the event is 
shown with an 
unambiguous launching effect nearby, almost all subjects now see the 'overlap' event as 
a launching.
Causal capture means that we can show subjects a sequence with complete overlap and 
still have the report a causal effect.

hypothesis have taken up. The favored view is one in which separate
modules are responsible for descriptions of objects and of their
mechanical interactions, with central mechanisms then resolving potential
conflicts between them. 
For example, Leslie (1988) argues that perceptual
modules do not by themselves settle inconsistencies between the spatial
positions of objects and their causal interactions. In certain 
illusions, adults tend to perceive solid objects passing through each other
(Leslie cites the Pulfrich double-pendulum illusion; see Wilson &
Robinson, 1986). Thus, the module for object tracking doesn’t prohibit
interpretations of physical events that are causally impossible. Of
course, people realize that such events cannot really be taking place and
are surprised when they perceive them, but that is because they have
principles stored in long-term memory—for example, the principle that two
solid objects cannot be in the same place at the same time—that classify
these events as illusions or anomalies. Leslie’s argument suggests
that people individuate objects and calculate their causal relations by
means of separate mechanisms; thus, we can’t count on causal constraints
being part of the object-tracking module. If Leslie is right, there is
reason to question Butterfill’s (2009) conjecture that ‘object
perception and causal perception are one and the same process’’ (p.
421).’

            <div class="notes">Response: it was too simple to say that 
‘object perception and causal perception are one and the same process’ or to
talk about ‘object perception and physical reasoning’ because object perception 
is a complicated thing with many aspects.
What Carey and Spelke (and following them, Butterfill) should have said is that
there is a system of object indexes which assigns indexes in ways that reflects
physical constraints such as solidity on objects’ motions, and this is what gives
rise to the launching effect.

Ingeniously, Michotte compares launching with the movement of a single object. The single 
object moves half way across a screen then pauses before continuing to move. Michotte found 
that the longest pause between the two movements consistent with subjects experiencing them 
as a single movement is around 80ms, exactly the longest pause consistent with experiences 
characteristic of launching \citep[pp.\ 91--8, 124]{Michotte:1946nz}. Accordingly, the 
experience characteristic of launching appears to require that the two movements be 
experienced as uninterrupted—--this is why they can be separated by a pause of up to but 
no longer than 80ms.

          <div class="notes">In slightly more detail: one function of our perceptual systems is to identify and track 
objects; this is done by means of various cues; sometimes the visual system is faced with 
conflicting cues to object identity which need to be resolved in order to arrive at a 
satisfactory interpretation; when certain types of causal interaction occur there is a 
conflict among cues to object identity; these conflicts must be treated differently from other 
conflicts because they do not indicate failures of object identification and so do not  
require resolution or further perceptual processing. 
So object perception depends on sensitivity to certain types of causal interaction and this is 
why the launching effect occurs.

          <div class="notes">This is unexpected insofar as perception is often supposed to be limited to features of the 
world less abstract that causal interactions.  Indeed, the notion that perceptual processes
represent three-dimensional objects rather than mere surfaces was at one time controversial.
The research we have reviewed shows that perceptual processes represent not only 
three-dimensional but properly physical objects, that is, objects capable of causally
interacting with each other.
