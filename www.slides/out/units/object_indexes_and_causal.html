          <p>How to get beyond intuition?</p>
          <p>The launching effect: detecting a 50ms difference in the delay between two movements.</p>
          <div class="notes">Part of the answer is this.  We don't worry about the content of the verbal reports.
We just focus on the fact that their content changes depending on a tiny, 50 millisecond
difference in the delay between two movements.
Call this \emph{launching effect}.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">This doesn't tell us what people are detecting.
But it does tell us that the effect is not merely confabulation or making it up.
So we have taken a tiny step beyond intuition.  But we also have to answer two questions.

            <div class="notes">But before we get to that, what is this about causal interactions?
It's reasonably obvious that object indexes require segmentation (otherwise how would they
attach to *objects*), and the evidence that they can survive occlusion is relatively easy to
understand.  But the point that having object indexes involves tracking causal interactions
is less straightforward.  So let's consider that ...

        <div class="notes">Object indexes are linked to causation.
In order to track objects, a perceptual system has to be sensitive to be causal interactions
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Why is this true?
Because when you have a causal interaction, there's a conflict between principles of object 
perception e.g. distinct surfaces=>two objects, vs good continuity of motion=>one object
The perceptual system needs to know when conflicts should be reconciled and when they should 
be written off.
We get perceptual effects of causal interactions when there are conflicts among cues of object 
identity.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">This is a point Michotte made.  He found that launching occurs when there is a conflict between 
cues to object identity: good continuity of movement suggests a single object whereas the 
existence of two distinct surfaces indicates two objects.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">It is plausible that other types of causal interaction also involve conflicts between cues 
to object identity.

in launching but not in various spatio-temporally similar sequences.  Since the object-specific 
preview effect is regarded as diagnostic of feature binding, this is evidence that in launching 
sequences, features of the second object (such as motion) remain bound to the first object for 
a short time after the second object starts to move.

So it can't be a consequence of thinking about the interaction.
Still, it might be a consequence of perceiving objects in certain relations to each other.

Surprisingly, we don't first perceive objects and then get the launching effect;
rather, the launching effect is tied up with perceptual process of identifying objects' surfaces.

As I said,
normally, if the two balls overlap completely, subjects report seeing a single object 
changing colour.
But if we show subjects a sequence like the launching effect but where the first square 
overlaps the second's position before it moves.  When this event is shown is isolation 
almost all subjects see it as a single object changing colour.  But when the event is 
shown with an 
unambiguous launching effect nearby, almost all subjects now see the 'overlap' event as 
a launching.
Causal capture means that we can show subjects a sequence with complete overlap and 
still have the report a causal effect.

          <div class="notes handout">Why does the illusory causal crescent appear?  Scholl and Nakayama suggest a  
‘a simple categorical explanation for the Causal Crescents illusion: the visual system, 
when led by other means to perceive an event as a causal collision, effectively 
‘refuses’ to see the two objects as fully overlapped, because of an internalized 
constraint to the effect that such a spatial arrangement is not physically possible. 
As a result, a thin crescent of one object remains uncovered by the other one-as 
would in fact be the case in a straight-on billiard-ball collision where the motion 
occurs at an angle close to the line of sight.’

Contrast Spelke’s view.
‘objects are conceived: Humans come to know about an object’s unity, boundaries, and 
persistence in ways like those by which we come to know about its material composition 
or its market value.’

        <div class="notes">This is an important question insofar as we are concerned with detecting causal interactions.
Is what people detect when the launching effect occurs a causal interaction?
You might say, it can't be a causal interaction 
because no delay between two movements is consistent with a causal interaction.

          <p class="em-above notes show">‘anyone not very familiar with the procedure involved in framing the physical concepts of 
inertia, energy, conservation of energy, etc., might think that these concepts are simply

          <div class="notes">How is this consistent with the laws of mechanics—surely no pause can be tolerated? 
Ingeniously, Michotte compares launching with the movement of a single object. The single 
object moves half way across a screen then pauses before continuing to move. Michotte found 
that the longest pause between the two movements consistent with subjects experiencing them 
as a single movement is around 80ms, exactly the longest pause consistent with experiences 
characteristic of launching \citep[pp.\ 91--8, 124]{Michotte:1946nz}. Accordingly, the 
experience characteristic of launching appears to require that the two movements be 
experienced as uninterrupted—--this is why they can be separated by a pause of up to but 
no longer than 80ms.

        <div class="notes">The question for this section was:</div>

        <div class="notes">Now I think we have achieved an answer:
        </div>
        <p class="em-above notes show">Perceptual systems identify certain kinds of causal interaction in the course of 
tracking objects.
        </p>
        <div class="notes">The perceptual system responsible for identifying objects must also concern itself with certain 
kinds of causal interaction in order to reconcile conflicting cues to object identity.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">In slightly more detail: one function of our perceptual systems is to identify and track 
objects; this is done by means of various cues; sometimes the visual system is faced with 
conflicting cues to object identity which need to be resolved in order to arrive at a 
satisfactory interpretation; when certain types of causal interaction occur there is a 
conflict among cues to object identity; these conflicts must be treated differently from other 
conflicts because they do not indicate failures of object identification and so do not  
require resolution or further perceptual processing. 
So object perception depends on sensitivity to certain types of causal interaction and this is 
why the launching effect occurs.

          <p>Causal interactions are detected by the perceptual processes involved in segmenting
and tracking objects.
          </p>
          <div class="notes">This is unexpected insofar as perception is often supposed to be limited to features of the 
world less abstract that causal interactions.  Indeed, the notion that perceptual processes
represent three-dimensional objects rather than mere surfaces was at one time controversial.
The research we have reviewed shows that perceptual processes represent not only 
three-dimensional but properly physical objects, that is, objects capable of causally
interacting with each other.
