An early idea was that infants’ earliest abilities involved
knowledge of physical objects.  On this view, infants know simple principles
governing how objects behave (for example, that they follow continuous paths through
space and time) and infants know the locations of some briefly occluded objects.
In an early paper Spelke offered a strong statement of this view.</div><div class="slide"><div class="spelke-quote notes show"><p class="quote em-above">‘objects are conceived: Humans come to know about an object’s ... boundaries ... in ways like those by which we come to know about its material composition or its market value’</p><p class="right">Spelke 1988, p. 198</p></div><div class="notes">But there are now some compelling objections to the view that
infants know the facts about the locations of briefly occluded objects ...</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".layer0" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:0}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;hidden&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div data-what=".layer.shinskey-2001" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">To illustrate, consider an ingenious experiment by \citet{Shinskey:2001fk}.
There was an opaque screen that could rotate between lying flat on the ground and being raised to conceal a toy behind it.
\citeauthor{Shinskey:2001fk} also used a second piece of apparatus just like the first except that the screen was transparent rather than opaque.
They reasoned that infants would quite often pull the screen forwards just for fun, regardless of what is behind it.
However, they also guessed that when infants know there is an interesting toy behind the screen, then they will pull it forwards more often than when they know that there is nothing behind the screen.
This is just what happened when infants were presented with the apparatus involving a transparent screen:
they sometimes pulled the screen forwards when there was no toy behind it, but they pulled it forwards significantly more often when the toy was behind it.
What happened  when infants were presented with the opaque screen?
Here infants pulled the screen forwards no more often when they had observed a toy being placed behind it then when they had observed that there was nothing behind it.
This is evidence that  seven-month-old infants do not know that a toy they have very recently seen hidden behind a screen is behind the screen.
After all, since knowledge guides action we would expect infants who know that a toy is behind an opaque screen to pull the screen forward more often than infants who know there is nothing behind the screen, just as they do when the screen is transparent.</div><div class="notes">More than two decades of research strongly supports the view that 
infants fail to search for objects hidden behind barriers or screens 
until around eight months of age \citep[p.\ 202]{Meltzoff:1998wp} or 
maybe even later \citep{moore:2008_factors}.
Researchers have carefully controlled for the possibility that infants’
failures to search are due to extraneous demands on memory or the 
control of action.
We must therefore conclude, I think, that four- and five-month-old 
infants do not have beliefs about the locations of briefly occluded 
objects.  
It is the absence of belief that explains their failures to search.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".layer.shinskey-2001" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:0}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;hidden&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div data-what=".layer.shinskey-2001-results" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">Here are their results with 7-month old infants.</div><div class="notes">We are interested in whether infants were more likely to pull the screen forwards when the 
object was present than when it was absent.
Since infants wanted the toy, if they knew it was behind the barrier they should have pulled
forward the barrier more often when the toy was behind it.
This is exactly what they did when the barrier was transparent.
But look what happens when the barrier is opaque, so that the toy is not visible to infants 
when they have to prepare the pulling action: they no longer pull the barrier more often
when the toy was behind it.</div><div class="notes">This is good evidence that 7 month olds do not know facts about the locations of objects 
they cannot perceive.
And this is not isolated evidence; for example, \citet{moore:2008_factors} use a different 
methods also involving manual search to provide converging evidence for this conclusion. 
But now we have a problem ...</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".layer.shinskey-2001-results" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:0}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;hidden&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div data-what=".layer.charles-rivera" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div data-what=".charles-rivera .endarkening" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:0}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;hidden&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:0}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">Because this point is controversial, I want to mention one further

\citet{charles:2009_object} compared what happens when an object is momentarily hidden behind a screen with what happens when an object is momentarily  hidden by darkness.
They used a trick with light and mirrors so that for some of the infants, the object did not reappear when the screen came up or the light returned.
Surprisingly, five-month-old infants’ looking times indicated that an expectation had been violated only when the object was hidden behind a screen but not when hidden by darkness.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".v-of-e .endarkening" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">So five-month-olds not only sometimes fail to search for hidden objects but
