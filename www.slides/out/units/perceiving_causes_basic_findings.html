much as adults do \citep{Leslie:1987nr}.</div><div class="notes">[nb: Several people have discussed this in seminars so I won't discuss it here (the reference is on your handout).]</div><div class="notes">In their experiment, they compared two groups of infants.
The first group was habituated to the top display, which is just the sort of animation Michotte
used to get reports of causal experiences in adults.
After habituation, this first group was then shown the same display except that the direction was 
reversed.
Meanwhile a second group was habituated to a display like the top display here except 
that there was a delay between the first object stopping and the second object starting.
This delay would mean that, in adults, there are no reports of experiences of a causal interaction.
After habituation, this second group was shown the same display except that the direction of 
movement was reversed.</div><div class="notes">Of interest was whether the first group showed greater dishabituation to the reversal than 
the second group.
How could this tell us anything about infants' experiences?
Suppose that infants do not have anything like what adults report as an experience of causation.
They they experience merely patterns of movement.
And, in this case, reversing on sequence should create no more interest than reversing the other.
But now suppose that infants do have something like what adults report as an experience 
of causation?
Then, when reversing the first sequence, there are two changes: there is a change both to the 
movement and to the character of the causal interaction.  To put it informally,
reversing direction means that the patient of the interaction becomes its agent.
So the hypothesis that infants' experiences of Michotte-like stimuli resemble adults 
predicts that there will be greater dishabituation when the first, `direct launching` sequence 
is reversed.</div><div style="position:relative;"><img src="/img/leslie_1987_fig4.png" style="clip: auto; position: absolute; max-width:720px; max-height:550px;"/></div><p class="source">Leslie & Keeble 1987, figure 4</p><div class="notes">This result seems robust:
\citep[p.~ 30]{hubbard:2012_phenomenala}: ‘Belanger and Desrochers (2001) replicated findings of
Leslie and Keeble (1987) and others that 6-month old infants dishabituated more to reversal of a
launching effect stimulus than to reversal of a noncausal (spatial gap or temporal gap) stimulus.’

\citep[pp.~ 30--1]{hubbard:2012_phenomenala}:‘Schlottmann et al. (2012) habituated 4-, 5-, and
6-month old infants to displays of a (a) reaction effect stimulus or (b) reaction effect stimulus
with a temporal gap between the launcher and the target. ... The data were consistent with Leslie
and Keeble’s (1987) finding that 6-month old infants dishabituated more to a reversal of a launching
effect stimulus than to a reversal of a noncausal stimulus.’</div><div class="notes">This paradigm also works with chimps:
\citep[p.~505]{hubbard:2012_phenomenal}: ‘O’Connell and Dunbar (2005) adapted the habituation paradigm used with human infants (e.g., Leslie 1982; Leslie and Keeble 1987) and presented causal stimuli or noncausal stimuli to chimpanzees. Dishabituation was greater for chimpanzees habituated to a causal stimulus and presented with a noncausal stimulus than for chimpanzees habituated to a noncausal stimulus and presented with a causal stimulus, and this was interpreted as consistent with causal perception.’</div></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><div style="" class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="notes">And this is just what the researchers found.

In infants we have discrimination and in adults we have verbal reports.
