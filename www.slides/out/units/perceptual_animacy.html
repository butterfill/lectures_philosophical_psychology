the detection by broadly perceptual processes of animate objects and their targets.
To illustrate, consider a groundbreaking experiment by \citet[experiment 1]{gao:2009_psychophysics}.
Adults were shown a display which contained some moving circles.
In some cases the circles moved independently of each other, but in other cases there was a ‘wolf’
which chased a ‘sheep’ with varying degrees of subtlety.
The adults’ task was simply to detect the presence of a wolf.
\citeauthor{gao:2009_psychophysics} established that adults can do this providing the chasing is not too subtle.
In further experiments, they also showed that adults’ abilities to perceptually detect chasing
depend on several cues including whether the chaser ‘faces’ its target (‘directionality’) and how
directly the chaser approaches its target (‘subtlety’).
The detection of animacy appears to be a broadly perceptual phenomena since it depends on areas of
the brain associated with vision and influences how perceptual attention is allocated
\citep{scholl:2013_perceiving} irrespective of your beliefs and intentions
\citep{buren:2016_automaticity}.</div></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><div style="" class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div style="position:relative;"><img src="/img/gao_2009_fig4a.png" style="clip: auto; position: absolute; max-width:720px; max-height:550px;"/></div><p class="source">Gao et al, 2009 figures 3b, 4a</p></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><div style="" class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><div class="notes">[This comparison is a bit confused because pure-goal tracking is the kind of thing

between a chaser and its target.
However the perceptual detection of animacy is clearly distinct from goal tracking.%
\footnote{%
Contrast \citet{schlottmann:2010_goal,Scholl:2000eq} who all claim that perceptual animacy is a matter of, or involves, tracking goals.
}
For one thing, it involves detecting relations between objects in motion rather than outcomes to
which actions are directed.
Relatedly, it does not involve sensitivity to the type of action.
Finally, the perceptual detection of animacy appears to depend on simple cues and heuristics and is
unlikely to be correctly described by the Teleological Stance.
For these reasons, we should distinguish the perceptual detection of animacy from tracking goals to which actions are directed.</div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div style="z-index:-22;" class="right-half-white hide"></div><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_6 words left-half"><div style="padding-right:1em;"><div class="notes show"><p>Conjecture</p><p class="em-above">In 9-month-olds,</p><p class="hem-above">all pure goal-tracking is explained by the Motor Theory;</p><p class="hem-above">appearances that goal-tracking is not limited by their abilities to act
