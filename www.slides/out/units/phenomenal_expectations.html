Contrast two sensory encounters with this wire. In the first you visually 
experience the wire as having a certain shape. In the second you receive an 
electric shock from the wire without seeing or touching it.%
\footnote{This illustration is borrowed from Campbell (2002: 133–4); I use it to support a claim weaker than his.}
The first sensory encounter involves perceptual experience as of a property of
the wire whereas, intuitively, the second does not. 
I take this intuition to be correct.%
\footnote{
Notice that the intuition is not that the shock involves no 
perceptual experience at all, only that the shock does not involve 
perceptual experience as of any property of the wire. Notice also that the 
intuition concerns what a perceptual experience is as of, and not directly 
what is represented in perception. The relation between these two is 
arguably not straightforward (compare, e.g., \citet[p.~28]{Shoemaker:1994el} or 
\citet[pp.~50--2]{Chalmers:2006xq} on distinguishing representational from 
phenomenal content).
}</div><div class="notes">The intuition is potentially revealing because the electric shock involves 
rich phenomenology, and its particular phenomenal character depends in part 
on properties of its cause (changes in the strength of the electric current 
would have resulted in an encounter with different phenomenal character). 
So there are sensory encounters which, despite having phenomenal characters 
that depend in part on which properties are encountered, are not perceptual 
experiences as of those properties.</div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><img src="/img/bush-obama.jpg" width="1024px" class="bkg"/><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><div class="notes">What is a phenomenal expectation?  Consider a third (and final) illustration.</div><div class="notes">Here is a face that I hope will seems familiar to most people.
When you see this face, you have a feeling of familiarity.
This feeling of familiarity is not just a matter of belief:
even if you know for sure that you have never encountered the person
depicted here (and trust me, you haven’t), the feeling of familiarity
will persist.
Nor is the feeling a matter of perceptual experience: you can’t 
perceptually experience familiarity
any more than you can perceptually experience electricity.</div><div class="notes">(The face is a composite of Bush and Obama.  It is chosen to illustrate that
the feeling of familiarity is not a consequence of how familiar things 
actually are; instead it may be a consequnece of 
the degree of fluency with which unconscious processes can identify 
perceived items \citep{Whittlesea:1993xk,Whittlesea:1998qj}.
Learning a grammar can also generate feelings of familiarity.
Subjects who have implicitly learned an artificial grammar report feelings 
of familiarity when they encounter novel stimuli that are part of 
the learnt grammar \citep{scott:2008_familiarity}.
They are also not doomed to treat feelings of familiarity as being
about actual familiarity:
instead subjects can use feeling of 
familiarity in deciding whether a stimulus is from that grammar 
\citep{Wan:2008_familiarity}.)</div><div class="notes">I could go on to mention the feeling you have when someone’s eyes are 
boring into your back, or the feeling that a name is on the tip of your 
tongue.  
But let me focus just on the feelings associated with electricity and 
with familiarity.
These feelings are paradigm cases of phenomenal expectation.</div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><div class="notes">All three examples (the feelings of magic, of electricity and of

Reid’s sense.%
\footnote{
\citet{Reid:1785cj,Reid:1785nz}.
Even if you don’t believe that there are sensations in Reid’s sense,
thinking of phenomenal expectations as if they were sensations will
serve to illustrate their characteristic features.
The main points that follow are consistent with several different ways of
thinking about phenomenal expectations.
For instance, you might take the view that 
what I am calling phenomenal expectations are
perceptual experiences of the body or of bodily reactions,
or that they involve some kind of cognitive phenomenology.
The essential claim is just that the phenomenal expectations associated with
the operations of object indexes are not constituted by states which involve
intentional relations to any of the things which are assigned an object index.

\begin{enumerate}
\item monadic properties of events, specifically perceptual experiences,

\item which alter the overall phenomenal character of those experiences
\item in ways not determined by the experiences’ contents 
(so two perceptual experiences can have the same content while one has a sensational property which the other lacks).

only via associations or further beliefs.
They are signs which need to be interpreted by their subjects
(\citealp[Essay~II, Chap.~16, p.~228]{Reid:1785cj}
\citealp[Chap.~VI sect.~III, pp.~164–5]{Reid:1785nz}).
Let me explain.</div><div class="notes">As a scientist, you can pick out the feeling of familiarity as that
phenomenal expectation which is normally caused by the degree to which
certain processes are fluent.
But as the subject of who has that phenomenal expectation, you do not 
necessarily know what its typical causes are.
This is something you have to work out in whatever ways you work out
the causes of any other type of event.</div><div class="notes">(Contrast phenomenal expectations with perceptual experiences.
Having 
a perceptual experience of, say, a wire’s shape, involves standing
in an intentional relation to the wire’s shape; and the phenomenal
character of this perceptual experience is specified by this 
intentional relation.%
\footnote{
Compare \citet[p.~380]{Martin:2002yx}:
‘I attend to what it is like for me to inspect the lavender bush through 
perceptually attending to the bush itself.’ 
And \citet[p.~211]{byrne:2001_intentionalism}
‘subject can only discover the phenomenal character of her experience by 
attending to the world ... as her experience represents it.’
}
Such perceptual experiences are often held to reveal the wire’s shape to the 
subject and so lead directly to beliefs.%
\footnote{
Compare \citet[p.~222]{Johnston:1992zb}:
‘[j]ustified belief … is available simply on the basis of visual perception’;
\citet[p.~143–4]{Tye:1995oa}:
‘Phenomenal character “stands ready … to make a direct impact on beliefs’;
and
\citet[p.~291]{Smith:2001iz}:
‘[p]erceptual experiences are … intrinsically … belief-inducing.’
})</div><div class="notes">(By contrast, having a phenomenal expectation concerning familiarity or an
physical object’s path does not involve standing in any intentional relation
to these things.
The phenomenal expectation is individuated by its normal causes, rather 
than by any intentional relation.
And a phenomenal expectation leads to belief, if at all, only indirectly.
For learning is required in order for the subject to come to a view on
what tends to cause the phenomenal expectation.)</div><div class="notes">Phenomenal expectations have been quite widely neglected in philosophy and
developmental psychology.
They are a means by which cognitive processes enable perceivers to 
acquire dispositions to form beliefs about objects’ properties which are 
reliably true.    
Phenomenal expectations provide a low-cost but efficient bridge between 
non-conscious cognitive processes and conscious reasoning.</div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></body></html>
