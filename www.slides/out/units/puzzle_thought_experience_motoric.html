    <title>A Puzzle about Thought, Experience and the Motoric | Philosophical Psychology</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Motor representations occur when merely observing others act and sometimes influence thoughts about the
goals of observed actions. Further, these influences are content-respecting: what you think about an
action sometimes depends in part on how that action is represented motorically in you. The existence of
such content-respecting influences is puzzling. After all, motor representations do not feature
alongside beliefs or intentions in reasoning about action; indeed, thoughts are inferentially isolated
from motor representations. So how could motor representations have content-respecting influences on
thoughts?"/>

practical reasoning. But motor representation, unlike belief and intention, does not feature in

            <div class="notes">[significance]
This may matter for understanding thought about action. On the face of it, the inferential
isolation of thought from motor representation makes it reasonable to assume that an account of
how humans think about actions would not depend on facts about motor representation at all. But
the discovery that motor representations sometimes shape experiences revelatory of action
justifies reconsidering this assumption. It is plausible that people sometimes have reasons for
thoughts about actions, their own or others', that they would not have if it were not for their
abilities to represent these actions motorically. To go beyond what we have considered here, it
may even turn out that an ability to think about certain types of actions depends on an ability
to represent them motorically.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">[consequence]
One consequence of our proposal concerns how experiences of one's own actions relate to
experiences of others' actions. For almost any action, performing it would typically involve
receiving perceptual information quite different to that involved in observing it. This may
suggest that experiences involved in performing a particular action need have nothing in common
with experiences involved in observing that action. However, two facts about motor
representation, its double life and the way it shapes experience, jointly indicate otherwise. For
actions directed to those goals that can be revealed by experiences shaped by motor
representations, there are plausibly aspects of phenomenal character common to experiences
revelatory of one's own and of others' actions. In some respects, what you experience when others
act is what you experience when you yourself act.

        <div class="notes">Here is the argument. Consider two sequences of sensory encounters: (a) a sequence of sensory
encounters with two phonetic events that do not differ with respect to category (both are
realisations of /d/, say), and (b) a sequence of sensory encounters with two phonetic events that do
so differ (one is a realisation of /d/ the other of /g/, say).11 Let the events encountered in the
first sequence differ from each other acoustically in the same way and by the same amount as the
events encountered in the second sequence differ from each other. (That it is possible to find two
such pairs of events follows from the fact that we enjoy categorical perception of speech.) The two
sequences are depicted in Fig. 3. Now:

We infer it from the facts about relevant acoustic features of the stimuli, and the
way acoustic processes work.
But we know that motor processes are also at work.

In fact we know that motor processes affect acoustic expeirences.

        <p class="source">Repp & Knoblich 2009, figure 3</p>
        <div class="notes">Repp and Knoblich (\citeyear{repp:2007_action}) asked expert and non-expert pianists to press two keys in sequence, where the first key was sometimes to the left, and sometimes to the right, of the second key.  The key presses produced an \emph{ambiguous tone pair}, that is, a pair with the property that the first tone is sometimes perceived as lower in pitch than the second whereas at other times it is perceived  as higher in pitch \citep{deutsch:1987_tritone}.   
The tones always occurred in the same order regardless of which key was pressed first.  By asking subjects to report how they perceived the relative pitches of the tones, Repp and Knoblich found that, for the expert pianists, the direction of the key presses influenced the perceived direction of the change in pitch. Could what influences experience in this case be not a motor representation but merely the occurrence of a movement, or perhaps even the perception of a movement of the subject's own fingers? Against these possibilities, note that the effect was not observed in non-expert pianists: for them the direction of movement did not measurably influence the perceived pitches. Since the direction of movement was the same for both groups, if the influence were due to movement only we would expect it to occur irrespective of piano-playing expertise. Instead it seems likely that differences in expertise between the two groups of subjects affected how the movements they performed were represented motorically, and that these differences in motor representation are in turn what explains their perceptions of relative pitches.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">It is not only in performing action that motor representation can influence experience: the same can occur in observing action. Thus in another experiment, Repp and Knoblich (\citeyear{repp:2009_performed}) compared observing someone else perform a sequence of key presses with performing the same sequence oneself.  They found the same effect on experiences of an ambiguous tone pair in expert pianists regardless of whether they were observing or performing the action.  
Sometimes, which judgement about pitch an experience provides a reason for depends on what is represented motorically; and this dependence is systematic, of course, for it reflects how pianos work.
These studies, and others like them,%
\footnote{
See also \citet{zwickel:2010_interference} who investigate effects of action on visual experience of motion, and \citet{schutz-bosbach:2007_perceptual} for a review.
}
provide relatively direct evidence that motor representation can shape experience.
