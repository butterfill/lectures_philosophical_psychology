When it comes to knowledge of others’ emotions, it might initially seem hard to imagine there could be a role for joint action because mere observation provides so much.
Because there are characteristic expressions of emotion, a mere observer can know of Lily’s amusement just from her facial expression.
Expressions of emotion plausibly also enable us to identify the objects of others’ emotions.
Since the causes of expressions like Lily’s smile are often enough the objects of the emotions they express, 
we can identify the objects of emotion using whatever sorts of causal reasoning enable us to work out what someone tripped over.
If you know what is causing Lily to smile you are probably in a position to know what she is amused by, that is the object of her amusement.</div><div class="notes">Emotions are not simply happiness or fear; they are things that unfold over time.
That initial jolt of fear as you hear the intruder enter your house is becomes intense as she moves closer, and then acquires an angry edge as you hear her breaking that vase your grandmother gave you.
Or imagine watching a clown falling over.  Your amusement might develop from an initial wince to growing hilarity that abruptly ends as the clown hits the floor, only to resurge as the wider comic significance of this event becomes apparent.</div><div class="notes">How could we gain insight into the fine-grained dynamics of others’ emotions?
How could we ever appreciate the unfolding of another’s grief, or the way their engagement leads to an explosion of ecstasy at the climax of a concert?
It's in answering this question that I think we may find support for the idea that collective intentionality enables us to know things about others' emtoions that we might not otherwise be in a position to know.
My thesis will be that Sharing a smile provides us with a route to knowledge of facts about the ways others' emotions unfold; this is what's special, rather than knowledge of the category of emotion (amusement vs fear) or its object.</div></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_share_smile_02.jpg" width="1024px" style="" class="bkg"/><div style="" class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="notes">[SECOND POINT: control is a way of knowing]</div><div class="notes">ways of knowing: perception, inference, reason, testimony</div><div class="notes">ways of knowing --- mention perceiving, testimony etc; </div></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_share_smile_03.jpg" width="1024px" style="" class="bkg"/><div style="" class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="notes">agent’s knowledge of their current and future actions is often thought to depend on control (although I guess perception is important---it's not a pure case);</div></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_share_smile_04.jpg" width="1024px" style="" class="bkg"/><div style="" class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="notes">but control can enable us to know things about others’ actions (using reins as an example---the point of putting a toddler in reins is sometimes that they enable you to know where the toddler will be without observation or inference); </div><div class="notes ctd">\footnote{</div><div class="notes ctd">Issue (Joel): does control give knowledge of action independently of perception.  (I launched into AHP, which I think only ends up supporting the point.)  Perception must be relevant in this sense: to know that I’m acting, my judgement must be appropriately sensitive to perceptual confirmation.  (Someone with AHP isn’t in a position to know that she’s acting precisely because the perceptual information doesn’t influence her judgement (the comparator---the link between perceptual feedback and motor representation---is broken).  (Strictly this doesn’t show that we need perceptual information, just that knowing isn’t compatible with ignoring perceptual information if  we have it.)  OK, but how does this affect the argument?  (i) maybe I shouldn’t offer agential control as a way of knowing that is distinct from perception (although I think that, unlike simple cases of perception, the motor representation plays a role in knowing.  Further (ii) what’s perceived is action not emotion in the proposal I make; but then maybe Joel’s objection is that merely controlling isn’t sufficient for knowing---against this, I think the reins example might help (I don’t need perceptual feedback to know the location of the toddler, although I might not be able know the location if I have perceptual feedback and ignore it.)</div><div class="notes ctd">}</div></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_share_smile_05.jpg" width="1024px" style="" class="bkg"/><div style="" class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="notes">then point out that social interactions often involve reciprocal control.</div><div class="notes">controlling someone's actions is a way of knowing things about them.</div><div class="notes ctd">\footnote{</div><div class="notes ctd">  Issue (Tom Smith): is reciprocal control sufficient for joint control?

(iv) There must be an experience that is distinctive of sharing a smile.
(iv) Note that I don’t want to say that  someone who is sharing a smile needs to understand the situation in the way I’m describing it.
  All I'm claiming is that the fact of reciprocal control somehow affects our awareness.
(v) It may affect in our awareness insofar as we are sensitive to contingencies between our own actions' and others' actions,
  and between our actions and the causes of them.
(vi) So my position is this: the reciprocal control justifies each agent in making judgements about how the others' amusement is unfolding,
    and this justification is at least indirectly available to the agents by virtue of their having experiences characteristic of sharing a smile.
  ]</div><div class="notes">Our being emotionally locked together means that 
to a significant extent I am feeling what you are feeling, 
        that the way my amusement is unfolding matches they way your amusement is unfolding. 
So if you know how your own amusement is unfolding and you know that we are emotionally locked together,
you can know much about how my amusement is unfolding.
So joint expressions of emotion like sharing a smile have the potential to enable us to know not just that others are amused but how their amusement is unfolding.</div><div class="notes">But the fact of reciprocal control (which means our emotions are locked together) together doesn’t all by itself mean that we can know how each other’s emotions are unfolding.
After all, for all I have said so far, we might, in sharing a smile, be  unaware that our emotions are locked together. 
Now you might think this sounds implausible because its hard to imagine sharing a smile without an experience that is distinctive of sharing a smile.
And it might be natural to describe this experience as an experience of sharing.
But even if that is correct, it’s necessary to say exactly why someone who is sharing a smile is in a position to know things about how the other’s emotion is unfolding.</div><div class="notes">I don’t want to say that interaction only helps if you know that your emotions are locked together. 
That is, I don’t want to say that  someone who is sharing a smile needs to understand the situation in the way I’m describing it.
But minimally the fact of reciprocal control must somehow feature in our awareness.</div><div class="notes">[*The idea in outline:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the ways our amusements unfold is locked together
\item this is in part because a single motor plan has two functions, production of your smile and prediction of my smile
\item the single motor process means that we might experience being locked together in some way (not that our emotions are locked together but that our actions are, in something like (but not exactly) we experience actions when seeing ourselves in a mirror or on CCTV (check Johannes’ discussion of this)).
\end{enumerate}
]</div><div class="notes">Here I want to offer a wild conjecture.
In joint expressions of emotion there is a single motor plan with two functions,
production and prediction.
The motor plan both produces your own smile and enables you to predict the way the other’s smile will unfold.
[*missing step about monitoring and experience.  (The Haggard idea: motor planning can give rise to experiences concerning one's own actions \citep{Haggard:2005sc}.)] 
Because your plan has this dual function, your experience of the other’s (my?) smile is special.
From your point of view, it is almost as if the other is smiling your smile.%
\footnote{
Joel caricatured this idea seeing me eating fruit: ‘it’s almost as if I’m eating that fruit.’
}
This means that sharing a smile has characteristic phenomenology.</div><div class="notes">This odd phenomenological effect means that in sharing a smile we can each think of the situation almost as if there were a single smile.
And almost as if there were a single state of amusement.
(In thinking of the situation like this it is important that we have a subject-neutral conception of the amusement and an agent-neutral conception of the smile.%
\footnote{
Tom Smith asked about this.  I clarified that I wasn’t suggesting there was a state of amusement which is ours, nor that the subjects are thinking of the situation in this way.
That’s the point of the appeal to subject-neutral amusement.
It’s a partial model of the situation.
}
[*Here I think I’m shifting back from the perspective of the participants in sharing a smile to the perspective of the theorist.
Probably what I should say is, first, that a theorist can think of the situation in this way and use this to argue, second, that there is a simple, partial conception of the situation that doesn’t require understanding reciprocal control and interlocking emotions but is sufficient for each smiler to have knowledge of  the way the other’s emotion unfolds.]
So my suggestion is that in sharing a smile you experience my smile almost as if it were yours (or: you experience me almost as if I were smiling your smile),
and so you might also experience our situation almost as if it involved a single state of amusement.</div><div class="notes">It's more like we each plan a single smile.</div><div class="notes">But---to reply to the objection---these plans have a dual function.
Your plan both produces your own smile and enables you to simulate---to experience---my smile.
And likewise for my plan.
The interdependence of our smilings means that we could each think of the situation as if it were one in which a single state of amusement were responsible for our actions.</div></div></div></div></section><section style="" class="slide"><div style="" class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><p class="center">collective intentionality opens a route to knowing others’ minds</p><div class="notes">I've just been arguing that manifestations of collective intentionality enable us to know things about others' minds that we might not otherwise be in a position to know.
In particular, I suggested that 
sharing a smile provides us with a route to knowledge of facts about the ways others' emotions unfold.
\textbf{
Engaging in collective actions like sharing a smile (and crying together) enables us to understand others’ emotions in ways that we probably couldn’t understand them if we were mere observers and unable to engage in collective action.
The joint expression of emotion matters because it makes available a perspective from which it is almost as if your amusement is my amusement, and my grief is yours.
