    <meta name="description" content="For a single action, which outcomes it is directed to may be multiply
determined by an intention and, seemingly independently, by a motor
representation. Unless such intentions and motor representations are to pull
an agent in incompatible directions, which would typically impair action
execution, there are requirements concerning how the outcomes they represent
must be related to each other. This is the interface problem: explain how any
such requirements could be non-accidentally met."/>

specify non-accidentally match.

either the occurrence of the A-outcomes would normally constitute or cause, at least partially, the
occurrence of the B-outcomes or vice versa. To illustrate, one way of matching is for the B-outcomes
to be the A-outcomes. Another way of matching is for the B-outcomes to stand to the A-outcomes as
elements of a more detailed plan stand to those of a less detailed one.

    <div class="handout">Imagine that you are strapped to a spinning wheel facing near certain death as it plunges you into
freezing water. To your right you can see a lever and to your left there is a button. In deciding
that pulling the lever offers you a better chance of survival than pushing the button, you form an
intention to pull the lever, hoping that this will stop the wheel. If things go well, and if
intentions are not mere epiphenomena, this intention will result in your reaching for, grasping and
pulling the lever. These actions---reaching, grasping and pulling---may be directed to specific
outcomes in virtue of motor representations which guide their execution. It shouldn't be an accident
that, in your situation, you both intend to pull a lever and you end up with motor representations
of reaching for, grasping and pulling that very lever, so that the outcomes specified by your
intention match those specified by motor representations. If this match between outcomes variously
specified by intentions and by motor representations is not to be accidental, what could explain it?

disproportionately reactive to environ- mental stimuli, carrying out
habitual behaviors that are inappropriate to the context, e.g., grabbing
food from a dinner companion’s plate (Della Sala 2005, 606). It is clear
from many of the behaviors observed in these cases that the anarchic limb
fails to hook up with the agent’s intentions.’

representations.’
            </div>
            <div class="notes">‘They are internal models or stored representations that represent generic knowledge
about a certain pattern of action and are implicated in the production and control of
action. For instance, in the influential Motor Schema Theory proposed by Richard Schmidt
(1975, 2003), a motor schema involves a generalized motor program, together with corre-
sponding ‘recall’ and ‘recognition’ schemas. The generalized motor program is thought to
contain an abstract representation defining the general form or pattern of an action,
that is the organization and structure common to a set of motor acts (e.g., invariant
features pertaining to the order of events, their spatial configuration, their relative
timing and the relative force with which they are produced). This generalized motor
program has parameters that control it. In order to determine how an action should be
performed on a given occasion, parameter values adapted to the situation must be
specified. Thus, a motor schema also includes a rule or system of rules describing the
relationships between initial conditions, parameter values and outcomes and allowing us
to perform the action over a large range of conditions (the ‘recall schema’ in Schmidt’s
terminology). Finally, the motor schema also includes a rule or system of rules
describing the relationships between initial conditions, exteroceptive and propri-
oceptive sensory feedback during an action, and action outcome (a recognition sche- ma),
allowing agents to know when they have made an error – i.e., the action does not have
the sensory consequences it is expected to have – and to correct for it.’
            </div>
            <div class="notes">Are motor schemas an alterantive to motor representations? Tempting to think that where
they talk about motor schema, we think of motor representations that represent outcomes
that are relatively distal from action (e.g. are affector-neutral).
            </div>
            <div class="notes">This would explain why they contrast motor schema with motor programmes. We use ‘motor
representation’ to include both.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">Consider an example ...
            </div>

            </div>
            <div class="notes">In Mylopoulos and Pacherie’s terms, you would need to say that this 
involves sameness of schema rather than sameness of motor representation.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">I think the difference is mainly terminological.  Because we are uncertain about
the nature of the motoric, we don’t distinguish motor representations that
specify actions in more detail (particular effector, particular grip) from
motor representations that specify actions in less detail.
Because they think that motor representations (or motor programmes) must be tied to
particular actions, they need motor schema.
(Partly this debate may hinge on the importance of bodily synergies and
nonrepresentational processes in the control of action: how much has to be represented
at all? More than intentions. But not necessarily each joint displacement. So we don’t
currently know where representation ends.)

Set that aside, suppose it can be solved --- essentially because MR must give rise to
experience of action.
On this view, it is demonstrative deference to motor representation that connects
intentions to bodily movements.
Only by recognising how intentions interlock with motor representations can we hope to
understand how our intentions ever make a difference to the world around us.
On this view experience of action plays a novel role.
Action experiences in which motor representations feature, such as those associated with
motor imagery and those associated with really acting, are arguably necessary for there to
be concepts which are constituents of intentions and refer to actions by deferring to
motor representations.
But if, as we conjecture, such deference is necessary for intentions to properly and
reliably result in bodily movements, it may turn out that intentionally acting in the
world de- pends on action experiences featuring motor representation.
Much as on some views thought about objects depends on perceptual experience (e.g.
Campbell 2002), so also intending actions may depend on motor experience.

There are no direct inferential connections between intentions and motor

forming a further intention or else the intention involves a demonstrative
that refers to an action by deferring to a motor representation.

experience that the motor representation gives rise to.  If so, there is no

We agree that this can’t happen --- we can’t easily make sense of the possibility that
your failed to refer, in intention, to the action you were trying to pick out.

          <div class="notes">I don’t understand this objection.  One problem is that the analogy seems to require 
only that we have an independent way of picking out the thing referred to.
But this is the action, not the motor representation.
(It is not part of our view that we demonstratively refer to motor representations.)
