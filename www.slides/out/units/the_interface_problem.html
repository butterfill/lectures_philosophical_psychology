representational formats, are related in such a way that, in at least some cases, the outcomes they
specify non-accidentally match.</div><div class="handout">‘both mundane cases of action slips and pathological conditions, such as apraxia or anarchic hand

to be the A-outcomes. Another way of matching is for the B-outcomes to stand to the A-outcomes as
elements of a more detailed plan stand to those of a less detailed one.</div><section class="slide"><div style="z-index:-22;" class="right-half-white hide"></div><div class="container_12"><div class="notes">Imagine that you are strapped to a spinning wheel facing near certain death as it plunges you into
freezing water. To your right you can see a lever and to your left there is a button. In deciding
that pulling the lever offers you a better chance of survival than pushing the button, you form an
intention to pull the lever, hoping that this will stop the wheel. If things go well, and if
intentions are not mere epiphenomena, this intention will result in your reaching for, grasping and
pulling the lever. These actions---reaching, grasping and pulling---may be directed to specific
outcomes in virtue of motor representations which guide their execution. It shouldn't be an accident
that, in your situation, you both intend to pull a lever and you end up with motor representations
of reaching for, grasping and pulling that very lever, so that the outcomes specified by your
intention match those specified by motor representations. If this match between outcomes variously
specified by intentions and by motor representations is not to be accidental, what could explain it?</div><div class="clear"></div><div class="words run-across"> <p class="center problem">The Interface Problem:</p><p class="center"><span class="qq hide">How are non-accidental matches possible?</span></p></div><div class="container_12"></div><div class="grid_6 words left-half"><div style="padding-right:1em;"><p>Motor representations specify goals.</p><div class="notes">As we have just seen, motor representations specify goals.</div><p class="slide em-above">Intentions specify goals.<div class="notes">And of course, so do intentions.</div></p><p class="slide em-above">Some actions involve both intention and motor representation.<div class="notes">Further, many actions involve both intention and motor representation.

If you asked a similar question about desire and intention, the answer would be 
straightforward: desire and intention are integrated in practical reasoning, so it 
is no surprise that what you intend sometimes nonaccidentally conforms to what you intend.
But we cannot give the same sort of answer in the case of motor representations and 
intentions because ...</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".inf-int" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">Intention and motor representation are not inferentially integrated.</div><div class="notes">Beliefs, desires and intentions are related to the premises and conclusions

disproportionately reactive to environmental stimuli, carrying out
habitual behaviors that are inappropriate to the context, e.g., grabbing
food from a dinner companion’s plate (Della Sala 2005, 606). It is clear
from many of the behaviors observed in these cases that the anarchic limb
fails to hook up with the agent’s intentions.’</div><div class="notes">In the rest of this talk I’m not going to suggest a solution to the interface problem.
