Or: We cook pizzas side-by-side = each exercise individual agency; we cook pizzas together = exercise 
shared agency.</div><div class="notes">This is only supposed to give you a sense of the notion, it is not a definition.
Different philosophers have offered wildly different, incompatible accounts of what shared 
agency is, and much of the course will be about trying to find our way around these.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".shared-agency" data-cls="bkg-invert" class="dv dv-removeclass"></div><p class="em-above">Why ask? </p><p class="indent"><span>Individual </span><span class="vs-aggregate hide">vs Aggregate </span><span class="miss-shared-agency hide">-- both miss shared agency</span><div class="notes">In philosophy of mind and action, it is normal to focus just on a single individual
who might as well be acting in isolation.  But if you think about almost any aspect of
cognition and agency, it is striking that it can’t be fully understood in isolation.
Our capacities for knowledge, emotion and action depend in numerous ways on our 
interactions with others.</div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".vs-aggregate" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">By contrast with philosophy, many disciplines such as economics and sociology do 
treat multiple individuals.  But on the whole this involves treating individuals
as indistinguisable from one another.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".miss-shared-agency" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">So once again, on the aggregate perspective, there is no room for shared agency.</div><div class="notes">There is growing awareness in cognitive science and philosophy that in missing
shared agency we may be missing something that shapes our lives and explains
much about why we humans are the way we are.
Excitingly, new techniques and technologies to investigate shared agency are 
being developed too.</div><div class="notes">At the same time there is an amazing degree of uncertainty and even confusion
among philosophers and theoretically-minded scientists.
It’s not just that there are different theories of shared agency; there is 
fundamental disagreement about what sort of conceptual and ontological resources
are needed, and about the questions such a theory should answer.
As you’ll see, there are even two completely unconnected articles on this topic
in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</div><div class="notes">So we face lots of challenges ...</div></div></p></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><p>terminology</p><p class="em-above">shared agency</p><p>joint action</p><div class="notes handout">A \emph{joint action} is an exercise of shared agency.</div><div class="notes">Joint actions include very small scale interactions such as hugging or sharing a 
smile, larger small group efforts like dancing together, going for a walk
or paining a house, and also epsiodes involving multiple agents and long periods 
of time like buidling a city or founding a democracy.</div><div class="slide"><p>‘collective’ action / agency</p><div class="notes">People sometimes use ‘collective’ rather than ‘joint’ or ‘shared’.  These terms
tend to be used interchangeably rather than to mark significant differences.
(Although Tomasello has made a reasonable suggestion.)
Terminology is a mess; as usual.</div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><p class="center">storytelling</p></div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"><p class="center">small-scale</p><div class="notes">I’ve been suggesting that
one fundamental, but neglected, feature of humans (and perhaps of other animals)
is that they are capable of joint action.  And I think that human’s (and perhaps other 
animals’) social nature depends on their capacity for joint action.
I’ve also been suggesting that this will be hard to study because there is a lot 
of quite deep disagreement among philosophers even about where to start.</div><div class="notes">The strategy: start with ‘modest socialty’ as Bratman characterises it.</div><div class="slide"><p class="handout notes show">Modest sociality: ‘small scale shared intentional agency in the absence of 
asymmetric authority relations’</p><p class="right grey-text">Braman 2009, p. 150</p><div class="notes handout ctd">\citep[p.~150]{Bratman:2009lv}</div></div><div class="notes">Why is this a reasonable strategy?  One consideration is that, developmentally and 
evolutionarily, modest sociality almost certainly came first.  So it is reasonable to 
hope that if we can understand this, we can build up to more complex cases.
Another, related thought is Fred Dretske’s maxim that you don’t know how something
works until you know how to build it.
It is a reasonable guess that in building agents capable of exercising shared agency,
a good first target is to get them started with modest sociality.</div><div class="notes">Note that this is only a starting point: we are also going to consider large scale
joint actions (like electing a president)
and very small scale joint actions (like sharing a smile or moving an egg).</div></div></div></div></div></section></div></body></html>
