Start with individual committment (which Gilbert calls ‘personal commitment’).
You can make an individual committment to me that you will write an essay,
and I can make an individual committment to you that I will mark it.
In this case the committment entails certain obligations and perhaps rights.
Gilbert’s idea is that several people can also become collectively committed,
in which case they have a joint committment which entails collective obligations.
So the idea is that a joint commitment
is something irreducibly collective.
This is an interesting idea which will become clearer later.
(We need to think more carefully about the basic individual/collective contrast.)
But for now I just want to note that Gilbert thinks along these lines ...</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".first-quote" data-css="{&quot;blur&quot;:&quot;2px&quot;}" data-options="{&quot;duration&quot;:500}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><ol class="em-above notes show"><li>Every event of acting together is a joint action.</li><li>Every joint action constitutively involves joint committment.</li></ol><div class="notes">If Gilbert is right the worry about the circularity of the Simple View is

There’s a lot you might extract from this behaviour (and we will return to the ants later), 
but for now just focus on the killing.
Each ant stings the large insect they have captured, where none of the stings are 
individually fatal although together they are deadly.
So when I tell you that the ants killed the large insect, this should be interpreted
collectively.  That is, it is not a matter of each ant killing the large insect;
rather killing is collectively predicated of the ants.</div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12 "><div class="words"><div class="middle"> <div class="notes">You have two minutes to think of two sentences which, like mine,
