a contrast case as involving an explanatory role of relevant intentions of the 
individual agent. ... I propose an analogous view ofthe shared case: the difference 
in the case of shared agency involves an appropriate explanatory role of relevant 
shared intentions. Our painting together is a shared intentional activity, 
roughly, when we paint together because we share an intention so to act.’

It allows us to give a parallel answer to the question about joint action:
a joint action is an event which is appropriately related to a shared intention.</div><div class="notes">So to the extent that we are persuaded by the standard account of which events are actions, 
it is natural to aim for a structurally parallel account of which events are joint actions.
To do this we merely have to characterise shared intentions.</div><div class="notes">As we shall see, there are long running, deep conflicts over the nature of shared 
intention.  The range of different approaches can be quite daunting.
This parallel between intention and shared intention is important because it is 
a rare point on wihch almost everyone will agree.

is this: shared intention is to joint action at least approximately what

The question was, Which events are joint actions?  
The answer was, those which stand in an appropriate relation to a shared intention.  
Then we ask what a shared intention is.  
And the answer is, it’s something in virtue of which events are joint actions.  
I don’t think the circle makes this completely useless;
but I’m mentioning the circularity to stress that we don’t yet have an account
of what shared intention is.

to anchor our understanding of what shared intention is by offering a point 
on which nearly everyone agrees.
(The point of agreement is this: shared intention is to joint action at least approximately what 
ordinary individual intention is to ordinary, individual action)</div><div class="notes">So still need an account of what shared intention is.
The first account we will look at in detail is Michael Bratman’s (well you cover 
Searle in the seminar so I don’t need to say much about that here).
