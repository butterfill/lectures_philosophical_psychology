          <div class="notes">On Davidson’s account of radical interpretation, we can think of its upshot
as an assignment of propositions to sentences.
The propositions give the truth conditions, or meanings, of the sentences and 
so enable us to identify the target’s beliefs and other propositional attitudes.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Because the evidence Davidson considers is attitudes towards whole sentences,
it turns out that, for any assignment of propositions to sentences,
there are ways of generating an alternative assigment of propositions to sentences
which is exactly as well supported by the evidence as the original assignment
of propositions to sentences is.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">So on Davidson’s account of radical interpretation, there is no possibility 
of uniquely determining the truth conditions, or meanings, of sentences.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">This is analogous to having a computational theory of a GPS device on which 
there is just no possibility of the device distinguishing between its being here
and its being at the same point on the opposite side of the earth.

If I gave you a computational theory of the GPS device that suffered from 
indeterminacy, you would rightly reject that theory because the device
can, as a matter of fact, determine which side of the planet it is on.
But should we take the same attitude towards Davidson’s theory.

          <div class="notes">The evidence Davidson starts from is changes in the attitude of holding
a sentence true.  To be detectable, such changes must involve the target
of interpretation uttering a sentence.
How are such events represented at the outset of radical interpretation?

            <div class="notes">If, on the other horn, they are represented as intentional actions, then
we are presupposing some insight into the contents of the target of radical
interpretation’s intentions.  
We know that she has an intention to express a particular attitude towards
a particular sentence.

            <div class="notes handout">‘The important limitation is that [the radical interpreter] doesn’t know in

be interpreted: she doesn’t know what he intends, believes, wants or means

            <div class="notes">Davidson might take this horn of the dilemma and just insist that 
his view of what an account of radical interpretation aims to achieve 
is a bit less exciting than I have been suggesting.
It doesn’t start from no insight into what someone intends, just relatively little.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">I think this response would be unsatisfactory given our interests in 
social cognition.  The hardest part is surely to understand the step from
*no* insight into others’ minds and actions to *some* such insight.
If Davidson’s account of radical interpretation is really just about 
the step from *some* insight into others’ minds and actions to a bit more 
insight, it might be interesting but it isn’t the theory we were looking for.
It won’t after all provide us with a computational theory of social cognition.

            <div data-what=".low-level" data-cls="bkg-invert" class="dv dv-addclass"></div>
            <div class="notes">Can Davidson instead take the first horn of the dilemma and say that the changes 
in attitude are represented merely as sequences of joint displacements,
bodily configurations and sounds?
            </div>
            <div class="notes">He might insist that as long as there is some account of how we get from the
joint displacement to the changes in attitude towards the sentence, 
there is no problem.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">So on this horn, Davidson’s radical interpretation project is the computational
theory of social cognition which we are looking for.  But it is incomplete because 
it doesn’t include an account of the transition from
joint displacements, bodily configurations and their effects (such as sounds)
to changes in attitude towards the truth of sentences.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">On the face of it, this doesn’t sound like there’s going to be an objection
to Davidson here.  But things get very interesting when we consider what is
currently known about how this transition is made.
Essentially, we will see that the capacities involved in getting from joint displacements,
bodily configurations and their effects (such as sounds) to goal-directed actions
provides a significant form of social cognition in its own right.

          <div class="notes">I think all of these objections arise from a single source.
Davidson’s account of radical interpretation starts and ends with 
linguistic expressions of changes in attitudes towards whole sentences.
It doesn’t consider simple object-directed actions like reaching for a mug
or catching a ball, and it doesn’t consider nonlinguistic communicative 
activities like pointing; nor does it consider expressions of emotion like 
some smiles and grimaces.

            <div class="notes">I take the view that social cognition involves multiple systems 
which operate on quite different principles.  So because I think
of an account of radical interpretation as providing a computational
description of a system, I have to reject the idea that there is just
one account of radical interpretation.
Instead we need multiple accounts of radical interpretation for
the multiple systems involved in social cognition.

This appears to involve taking a position substantially at odds with Davidson’s account
of radical interpretation insofar as the computational theory will look
quite different for perception ... the evidence that we start from will
not be linguistic expressions of changes in attitude towards sentences,
and the sorts of inference we make will probably not have the causal character
of the inferences Davidson makes use of in his account of radical interpretation.

radical interpretation by thinking about this question:
How do humans make the transition from bodily configurations, joint displacements
and their effects (e.g. sounds) to goal-directed actions?

Categorical perception of expressions of emotion is a form of goal ascription,
just as speech perception is.
So the Teleological Stance provides the computational description common to the
most fundamental forms of social cognition.]
