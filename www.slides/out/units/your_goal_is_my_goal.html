if an interpreter is engaged in an interaction with her target that involves a collective goal, 
it may be easy for the interpreter to know what the goal of her target's actions is because this 
goal is the goal of her own actions.
So if she knows the goal of her own actions and she knows that she is engaged with 
her target in an interaction involving a collective goal,
then she already knows what the goal of her target's actions are.</div><div class="notes">Roughly speaking, the mindreader can reason about her target thus: your goal is my goal.</div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".its-wrong" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">Of course this intuitive idea is no use it stands.  
For the inference it captures relies on the premise that the interpreter and her 
target are engaged in actions with a collective goal.

already know which goal her target's actions are directed to.</div></div><div class="slide"><p class="em-above center">but: cues to joint action</p><div class="notes">Fortunately there is a way around this.  
For there are various cues which signal that one agent is prepared 
to engage in some joint action or other with another,
and joint actions involve collective goals.  
\label{twin_pram}
Seeing you struggling to get your twin pram onto a bus and noticing you have 
the haggard look of a new parent, a passing stranger  grabs the front wheels 
and makes eye contact with you, raising her eyebrows and smiling.
(The noise of the street rules out talking.)   
In this way she signals that she is about to act jointly with you.   
Since you are fully committed to getting your pram onto the bus,
you know what the sole goal of your own actions will be.
But you also know that the stranger will engage in joint action with you,
which means that, taken together, her actions and your actions will have a collective goal.
This may enable you to infer the goal of the stranger's imminent actions: 
her goal is your goal, to get the pram onto the bus.</div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="slide"><img src="/img/whitney.png" width="1024px" class="bkg"/><div class="words"><div class="container_12"><div class="grid_12"><div class="handout notes">\begin{enumerate}

Let’s see how your-goal-is-my-goal enables you to avoid 
the problem of opaque means in each of these three cases.</div><div class="slide"><div class="eg"><p class="hem-around">e.g. pram -> bus<span class="step2">; gorilla preparing nettles</span></p></div><div class="eg"><p class="hem-around">e.g. tool use <span class="inversion-of-demand hide">illustrates inversion of demands</span></p></div><div class="eg"><p class="hem-around">e.g. communicative actions</p></div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".eg:eq(0)" data-cls="bkg-grey-row " class="dv dv-addclass"></div><div class="notes">Actually I already did this one in introducing the inference.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".eg:eq(0)" data-cls="bkg-grey-row " class="dv dv-removeclass"></div><div data-what=".eg:eq(1)" data-cls="bkg-grey-row " class="dv dv-addclass"></div><div class="notes">We saw earlier that the problem of opaque means  may impair goal 
ascription where actions involve novel uses for tools.
How could your-goal-is-my-goal mitigate the problem in such cases?
Imagine we are interacting with a young child,
Ayesha,
and want her to understand how a new tool is used.  
It is difficult to convey this to her directly.  
So we first get her interested in achieving an outcome that would require the new tool,
knowing that she will perform actions directed to achieving this outcome.  
We then signal to Ayesha that we will act jointly with her.  
Now she is in a position to know what the goal of our action will be when we deploy the tool.  
She is able to identify this goal 
despite being unable to recognize it as an end to which our tool-using action is a means.
She is able to identify this goal 
because she knows that this is her goal
and that we were attempting to engage in joint action with her.
This is one illustration of how 
interacting interpreters have at their disposal ways of
identifying the goals of actions involving novel uses of tools
which are unavailable to interpreters who can only observe.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".inversion-of-demand" data-css="{&quot;opacity&quot;:1}" data-options="{&quot;visibility&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:400}" class="dv dv-velocity"></div><div class="notes">As this example indicates,
exploiting your-goal-is-my-goal 
can shift the burden of identifying goals from a mindreader to her target.
In the example Ayesha is the focal mindreader and we are her target;
but her success in identifying the goal of our actions
depends on this,
that our willingness to act jointly with her is based on \emph{our} knowledge of the goals of \emph{her} actions.
In purely observational mindreading, the target's beliefs about the goals of the mindreader's actions are not normally relevant (except, of course, when the mindreader is ascribing such beliefs).
But interacting mindreaders who rely on your-goal-is-my-goal
thereby rely on their targets' having correctly identified the goals of their actions.
Of course this is sometimes a reason not to rely on your-goal-is-my-goal.
But where the target understands relevant means-ends relations,
such as actions involving novel tools,
the your-goal-is-my-goal route to knowledge of others' goals may sometimes be the only option.</div></div><div class="slide"><div data-what=".eg:eq(1)" data-cls="bkg-grey-row " class="dv dv-removeclass"></div><div data-what=".eg:eq(2)" data-cls="bkg-grey-row " class="dv dv-addclass"></div><div class="notes">This is a bit of a problem ...</div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></body></html>
