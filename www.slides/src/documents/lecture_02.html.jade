  TODO : should have metioned Fridland 2016 on the interface problem
  and the dynamic version of it.  (Although she seems to be working
  with a rather restricted version of what is motoric, e.g. she appears
  to assume that flexible goal-specific trajectory updates require 
  intention.)

    Any attempt to bring scientific discoveries about action into a philosophical
    discussion quickly runs into a significant obstacle ...
    [The obstacle will be apparently completely different way of thinking about action.]

    Which events are actions?
    In philosophy, answering this question would typically answered by appeal to intention 
    or practical reasoning.
  .notes: :t
    Such views tend to be neutral on how 
    the attitudes and processes ultimately connect to bodily movements; 
    that is considered to be merely an implementation detail ...
  .notes: :t
    They are neutral in this sense: the views do not depend in any way on facts about that 
    distinguish one kind of body from another, or on facts about how the body’s movements 
    are ultimately controlled ...

  .notes: :t
    In cognitive science ... little to say about actions whose purposes
    involve things the motor system doesn’t care about---your motor system
    doesn’t care whether the plane you are stepping is headed for Milan or
    for Rome, but this sort of difference can affect whether your actions succeed or fail.

    p.center talking past each other?
    .notes: :t
      You might just say that the two disciplines are talking past each other,
      or you might say that they are offering two complementary but independent
      models of action.
    .notes: :t
      Call this the ‘Two Stories View’ (or divorced, but living together).
    .notes: :t
      But we want to argue that these two views are components of a single, larger story about action.
      Although intention and motor representation can usefully be studied in isolation
      to some extent, a full understanding of action will require understanding
      interfaces between the two …
    .notes: :t
      But first let me fill in a little detail about each of the stories ...

    So where does this leave us with respect to our starting point,
    the ‘Two Stories’ view?
  .notes: :t
    On the face of it, everything I’ve said so far is compatible with that View
    and might even be taken to support it.
  .notes: :t
    But there is a problem ...

    Recall stealing an apple ...
+slide_middle({bkg:'planning_like/Slide5.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    Imagine you are a hungry shoplifter with a powerful desire for an apple.  After carefully 
    considering the pile of apples on the stall, you identify one that can be discretely 
    snatched and form an intention to steal that apple as you casually saunter past the stall.  
    In grasping, transporting and pocketing the apple your movements are controlled by motor 
    representations of these outcomes.  So your theft depends on an intention, on some motor 
    representations and on there being a match between the outcome specified by the intention 
    and the outcomes specified by the motor representations.
  .notes: :t
    In short: practical reasoning and motor processes are part of a single story about the 
    performance of action; there must be non-accidental matches between the contents of 
    intentions and motor representations.
  .notes: :t
    \textbf{So we can’t accept the Two Stories View because there must sometimes be content-respecting
    causal interactions involving intentions and motor representations.
    Without these, our intentions and motor representations would never non-accidentally
    have synergistic effects on our actions.}

  .notes: :t
    I started by observing that there are two quite different approaches to 
    answering the question, Which events are actions?
    Philosophers mostly invoke intention, whereas neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists
    focus on motor representation.
  .notes: :t
    What are we to make of the disparity? Are the two simply talking about different phenomena?
    I’ve offered two considerations which, taken together, suggest that they are not.
  .slide
    +blur('img.bkg', '5px')
    .notes: :t
      The first consideration is that
    p.notes.show Motor representations ground the directedness of actions to goals.
  .slide
    .notes: :t
      The second consideration is that
    p.em-above.notes.show Some actions involve both intention and motor representation.
  .slide
    .notes: :t
      Given these two considerations, it seems to me that, in some cases, nonaccidentally successful
      action requires that motor representations and intentions play a harmonious role in 
      guiding actions.
      In particular, their contents must match.
    .notes: :t
      But this requirement leads us to a question, which I’ve called ‘The Interface Problem’
    p.em-above.notes.show How are non-accidental matches possible?
    .notes: :t
      The interface problem is the problem of explaining how there could be nonaccidental matches
      between motor representations and intentions.
    .notes: :t
      In this talk I haven’t tried to solve the problem but merely mentioned five complications
      which anyone who tries to solve it faces.
    .notes: :t
      The interface problem is complicated by the \textbf{anatomy} of outcomes, the varying \textbf{scales}
      at which intentions can specify actions, and by the possibility of nonaccidental \textbf{dynamical} 
      matching.
    .notes: :t
      So while various researchers have proposed solutions to the Interface Problem -- Pacherie, Shepherd and 
      Butterfill and Sinigaglia, I’m doubtful that any are sufficient.
