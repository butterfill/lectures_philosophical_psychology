    In the middle you see the \emph{base}, i.e. the part of the spectrogram common to [ra] and [la]. This
    is played to one ear
  .notes: :t
    Below you see the transitions, , i.e. the parts of the spectrogram that differ between [ra] and [la].
    When played in isolation these sound like a chirp. When played at the same time as the base but in
    the other ear, subjects hear a chirp and a [ra] or a [la] depending on which transition is played.
  .notes: :t
    How do we know that the same stimuli may be processed by different perceptual systems
    concurrently—for instance, how do we know that speech and auditory processing are distinct? A
    phenomenon called “duplex” perception demonstrates their distinctness occurs in. Artificial
    speech-like stimuli for two syllables, [ra] and [la], are generated. The acoustic signals for each
    syllable is artificially broken up into two parts, the “base” and “transition” (see Fig. *** below).
    The syllables have the same “base” but differ in the “transition”. When the “transition” is played
    alone it sounds like a chirp and quite unlike anything we normally hear in speech. Duplex perception
    occurs when the base and transition are played together but in separate ears. In this case, subjects
    hear both the chirp that they hear when the transition is played in isolated, and the syllable [la]
    or [ra]. Which syllable they hear depends on which transition is played, so speech processing must
    have combined the base and transition. By contrast, auditory processing must have failed to combine
    them because otherwise the chirp would not have been heard. In this case, then, the perception
    resulting from the duplex presentation involves simultaneous auditory and speech recognition
    processes. This shows that auditory and speech processing are distinct perceptual processes.
  .notes: :t
    The duplex case is unusual. We can’t normally hear the chirps we make in speaking because speech
    processing inhibits this level of auditory processing. But plainly speech is subject to some auditory
    processing for we can hear extra-linguistic qualities of speech; some of these provide cues to
    emotional state, gender and class. Perception of these extra-linguistic qualities enables us to
    distinguish stimuli within a category. As already mentioned, this is a problem for Repp’s operational
    definition. Our ability to discriminate stimuli is the product of both categorical speech processing
    and non-categorical auditory processing. If we want to get at the essence of categorical perception
    it seems there is no alternative but to appeal to particular perceptual processes rather than
    behaviours.

    Categorical perception of mating calls and perhaps other acoustic signals is widespread in non-human
    animals including monkeys, mice and chinchillas (Ehret 1987; Kuhl 1987), and is even found in
    cognitively unsophisticated animals such as frogs (Baugh, Akre and Ryan 2008) and crickets
    (Wyttenbach, May and Hoy 1996).

    \emph{Articulatory Gesture:}
    In speaking we produce an overlapping sequence of articulatory gestures, which are motor actions
    involving coordinated movements of the lips, tongue, velum and larynx. These gestures are the units
    in terms of which we plan utterances (Browman and Goldstein 1992; Goldstein, Fowler, et al. 2003).

    The difference in differences ...
  .notes: :t
    Here is the argument. Consider two sequences of sensory encounters: (a) a sequence of sensory
    encounters with two phonetic events that do not differ with respect to category (both are
    realisations of /d/, say), and (b) a sequence of sensory encounters with two phonetic events that do
    so differ (one is a realisation of /d/ the other of /g/, say).11 Let the events encountered in the
    first sequence differ from each other acoustically in the same way and by the same amount as the
    events encountered in the second sequence differ from each other. (That it is possible to find two
    such pairs of events follows from the fact that we enjoy categorical perception of speech.) The two
    sequences are depicted in Fig. 3. Now:
+slide_middle
  p (1) The second sequence of sensory encounters, (b), differ from each other more in phenomenal character than the first sequence of sensory encounters, (a), differ from each other.
  p.slide (2) This difference in differences in phenomenal character is a fact in need of explanation.
  p.slide (3) The difference cannot be fully explained by appeal only to perceptual experiences as of acoustic features of the stimuli; after all, the stimuli encountered in each sequence, (a) and (b), differ equally in this respect.
  p.slide (4) The difference can be explained in terms of perceptual experiences as of phonetic properties if the above thesis is true for categorical perception of speech (how the explanation works is specified below).
  p.slide (5) There is no better explanation of the difference.
  .notes: :t
    The fourth step in this argument, (4), needs some filling in. How would the thesis that categorical
    perception of speech is a form of perceptual experience explain the difference in differences in
    phenomenal character? If the thesis is true, the first sequence of sensory encounters, (a), involves
    two perceptual experiences as of a single phoneme whereas the second sequence of encounters, (b),
    involves perceptual experiences as of different phonemes.12 Let us assume (not very controversially)
    that perceptual experiences have phenomenal characters and that which phenomenal character a
    perceptual experience has depends in part on what it is as of.13 It follows that differences in what
    perceptual experiences are as of can explain differences in the phenomenal characters of those
    perceptual experiences. In particular, if it is a fact that (b) involves perceptual experiences as
    of different things whereas (a) does not, this could explain why the sensory encounters in (b)
    differ in phenomenal character in a way that the sensory encounters in (a) do not.

    Infants enjoy categorical perception of speech from around four months of age or earlier.
    Prelinguistic infants’ categorical perception is adult-like in the sense that it is subject to
    complex effects of speaker and context on where perceptual category boundaries fall (Kuhl 1987:
    376–82, 2004: 834). Infants’ categorical perception also plays an important role in language
    acquisition (Eimas, Siqueland, et al. 1971; Jusczyk 1995; Saffran, Newport and Aslin 1996).

  .notes: :t
     Consider perceptually-based beliefs involving demonstrative concepts such as the belief that This
     phoneme is that phoneme. Children’s and adults’ untrained judgements about phonemes are often
     surprisingly inaccurate, and they are typically influenced by acoustic features such as sonority as
     well as their knowledge of spelling and linguistic structure (Scarborough, Ehri, et al. 1998;
     Treiman and Cassar 1997; Lehtonen and Treiman 2007; Hallé, Chéreau and Segui 2000). In addition,
     children tend to systematically misidentify phonemes depending on the context in which they appear
     (Treiman 1985: 197). Categorical perception is not similarly affected by these factors (Serniclaes,
     Ventura, et al. 2005). This is evidence for the view that whereas categorical perception tracks
     articulatory gestures, demonstrative concepts track some sort of hybrid acoustic-
     linguistic properties.20 This view is further supported by the fact that untrained subjects
     sometimes regard their phonetic beliefs as beliefs about the sounds which make up words (compare
     Scarborough, Ehri, et al. 1998: 119–20 on ‘little sounds’).

  p  Phenomenal character ‘stands ready and available to make a direct impact on beliefs’
  p.grey-text.right Tye, 1995 pp. 143–4 (see also 103–4)
  .notes: :t
    How does this bear on Tye’s claim that perceptual experiences stand “ready and available to make a
    direct impact on beliefs”? This claim implies that in good circumstances and where background
    conditions are met, the properties subjects enjoy perceptual experiences as of are also properties
    they can think about. Suppose categorical perception of speech were a form of perceptual experience.
    In that case, subjects would enjoy perceptual experiences as of articulatory gestures (or as of
    events or properties matching these in extension). Despite this, they fail to be able to think about
    any such properties, for, as we have seen, there is a large and systematic discrepancy between the
    boundaries of their perceptual categories and the extensions of the concepts involved in their
    judgements, even the simplest perceptually-based demonstrative judgements. All by itself this
    discrepancy carries little weight. For Tye’s claim about perceptual experiences making a direct
    impact on beliefs must allow for the possibilities of interference and inhibition from false
    beliefs. And in the case of categorical perception of speech, there is evidence that both
    interference and relevant false beliefs are present. But, crucially, these factors do not fully
    explain the extent of the discrepancies between categorical perception and belief (see footnote 20).
    Rather it appears that whereas categorical perception tracks one type of thing (articulatory
    gestures), demonstrative concepts track something altogether different (little sounds, perhaps). So
    if categorical perception of speech did involve perceptual experiences as of acoustic properties,
    its existence would be evidence against Tye’s claim that perceptual experiences stand “ready and
    available to make a direct impact on beliefs.”
  .notes: :t
    footnote 20: There are two alternative possible explanations for the discrepancies between
    categorical perception and phonetic judgements: subjects may find it difficult to attend to phonetic
    properties, and they may find it difficult to inhibit tendencies to make judgements on the basis of
    orthography. While both claims may be true (first claim: Treiman 1985: 199–200; second claim:
    Scarborough, Ehri, et al. 1998: 138), they do not fully explain the discrepancies.
