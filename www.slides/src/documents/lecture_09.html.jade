abstract: """
  Acting together with a purpose is a familiar feature of everyday life. People
  play duets, move pianos together, and drink toasts together. In such cases
  the actions people perform have a collective goal in at least this sense:
  they are directed to an outcome and this is not, or not only, a matter of
  each action being individually directed to this outcome. But in virtue of
  what do the actions people perform in acting together have collective goals?
  In considering a counterpart of this question concerning acting alone with a
  purpose, several philosophers have argued that it is necessary to identify a
  role for motor representations. By contrast, philosophical discussions of
  acting together have mainly ignored motor representation. They have also have
  neglected very small scale cases of acting together with a purpose such as
  two pianists playing a chord together, two people elevating a piano together,
  or two people clinking glasses. In this seminar I introduce a proposal to
  fill both gaps. The strategy is to generalise a view about goals and motor
  representations in acting alone with a purpose. The conclusion is that some
  cases of acting together with a purpose constitutively involve motor
  representations. This may have implications for understanding the varieties
  of ways in which people can act together.

    In this seminar, I will outline a minimal framework for theorising
    about joint action. 
    I will also argue that attention to the role of 
    motor representation in coordinating joint action
    proves unexpectedly helpful in enabling us to understand 
    the sophisticated sort of cooperative interactions that are often
    the focus of philosophical discussions of joint action.

    In conclusion, my question was about in virtue of what ... collective goals.
    Many researchers have answered this question by appeal to one or another kind of shared intention.
    What we have shown is that in some cases the right answer to the question involves 
    motor representation rather than intention.
    And, more tenatively, this suggests that there may be a role for motor representation
    in characterising joint action.
    Perhaps understanding joint action and shared intention requires appeal not just to intention, commitment and the rest,
    but also to motor representation.
