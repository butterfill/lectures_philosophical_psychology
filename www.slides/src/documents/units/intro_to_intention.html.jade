    The expression ‘the intention with which James went to church’ ... cannot be taken to refer to a ...
    state ....
  p: :t
    Its function ... is to generate new descriptions of actions in terms of their reasons;
  p: :t
    thus ‘James went to church with the intention of pleasing his mother’ yields a new, and fuller,
    description of the action described in ‘James went to church’.’

      Agglomeration is important because it distinguishes intention from desire, and from strongest desire.

  p.center What are intentions for?
  .notes: :t
    So what are intentions for?
  .notes: :t
    I’m going to assume that intention is something over and above basic beliefs and desires; that an
    intention is not, for instance, merely a strongest desire.
  .notes: :t
    There is a temptation to assume that intention is involved in every case of purposive action.
    But it’s hard to see what the argument for this could be.
    In many cases it seems that beliefs, desires and motor representations are all that is needed to explain purposive action. 
    You offer me a biscuit.  I want one, and I believe I can get one by reaching out for it.  So I do reach for it.  As far as I can see, there’s no need to suppose that, in addition to the belief and desire, it must be the case that I also intend to take a biscuit.  
    (At least not unless we take ‘intention’ to mean ‘strongest desire’, which it does not.)  
    Maybe I do intend this.  
    But it’s possible for an agent to take and eat a biscuit, and to do so purposively, without having any intentions at all.  
    Beliefs desires and motor representations are sufficient.
  .notes: :t
    So (again), what are intentions for?
    The answer has something to do with planning.  
    But here we must be careful because not all planning involves intending.

  p ‘why should rational agents like us have the capacity to have both 
  p ordinary intentions (subject to demands for consistency and agglomeration)

  p guiding desires (which are not subject to these demands)?’

//- THIS IS WHAT THE SECTION ON INTENTION BUILDS UP TO:
+slide
  p.question.hide  What is the relation between a purposive action and the outcome or outcomes to which it is directed?
  //- diagram is in joint_action_mixins
  +diagram_action_goal
  .notes: :t
    As this illustrates, 
    some actions involving are purposive in the sense that 
  .slide
    +show('.outcome')
    .notes: :t
      among all their actual and possible consequences, 
  .slide
    +show('.outcome.block .block-glow')
    .notes: :t
      there are outcomes to which they are directed
  .slide
    +show('.joint-action .neon-rect')
    .notes: :t
      and the actions are collectively directed to this outcome
  .slide
    +hide('.joint-action .neon-rect')  
    +show('.joint-action .neon-ellipse')
    .notes: :t
      so it is not just a matter of each individual action being directed to this outcome.
  .slide
    +hide('.joint-action .neon-ellipse')
    +show('.joint-action .neon-rect')
    .notes: :t
      In such cases we can say that the actions are clearly purposive.
  .slide
    +show('.question')
    .notes: :t
      Concerning any such actions, we can ask
      What is the relation between a purposive action and the outcome or outcomes to which it is directed?
  .slide
    +show('.explain-collective-directedness')
    .notes: :t
      The standard answer to this question involves intention.
  .slide
    +show('.represents')
    .notes: :t
      An intention (1) specifies an outcome, 
  .slide
    +show('.coordinates')
    .notes: :t
      (2) coordinates the one or several activities which comprise the action; 
    .notes: :t
      and (3) coordinate these activities in a way that would normally facilitate the outcome’s occurrence.
    .notes: :t
      What binds particular component actions together into larger purposive actions?  
      It is the fact that these actions are all parts of plans involving a single intention.
      What singles out an actual or possible outcome as one to which the component 
      actions are collectively directed?  It is the fact that this outcome is 
      represented by the intention.
    .notes: :t
      So the intention is what binds component actions together into purposive actions and 
      links the action taken as a whole to the outcomes to which they are directed.
  .slide
    +show('.iasmr')
    .notes: :t
      But is intention the only thing that can link actions to outcomes?
      I will suggest that motor representations can likewise perform this role.
