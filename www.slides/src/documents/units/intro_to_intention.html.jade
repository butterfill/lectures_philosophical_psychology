    As this illustrates, 
    some actions involving are purposive in the sense that 
  .slide
    +show('.outcome')
    .notes: :t
      among all their actual and possible consequences, 
  .slide
    +show('.outcome.block .block-glow')
    .notes: :t
      there are outcomes to which they are directed
  .slide
    +show('.joint-action .neon-rect')
    .notes: :t
      and the actions are collectively directed to this outcome
  .slide
    +hide('.joint-action .neon-rect')  
    +show('.joint-action .neon-ellipse')
    .notes: :t
      so it is not just a matter of each individual action being directed to this outcome.
  .slide
    +hide('.joint-action .neon-ellipse')
    +show('.joint-action .neon-rect')
    .notes: :t
      In such cases we can say that the actions are clearly purposive.
  .slide
    +show('.question')
    .notes: :t
      Concerning any such actions, we can ask
      What is the relation between a purposive action and the outcome or outcomes to which it is directed?
  .slide
    +show('.explain-collective-directedness')
    .notes: :t
      The standard answer to this question involves intention.
  .slide
    +show('.represents')
    .notes: :t
      An intention (1) specifies an outcome, 
  .slide
    +show('.coordinates')
    .notes: :t
      (2) coordinates the one or several activities which comprise the action; 
    .notes: :t
      and (3) coordinate these activities in a way that would normally facilitate the outcomeâ€™s occurrence.
    .notes: :t
      What binds particular component actions together into larger purposive actions?  
      It is the fact that these actions are all parts of plans involving a single intention.
      What singles out an actual or possible outcome as one to which the component 
      actions are collectively directed?  It is the fact that this outcome is 
      represented by the intention.
    .notes: :t
      So the intention is what binds component actions together into purposive actions and 
      links the action taken as a whole to the outcomes to which they are directed.
  .slide
    +show('.iasmr')
    .notes: :t
      But is intention the only thing that can link actions to outcomes?
      I will suggest that motor representations can likewise perform this role.
