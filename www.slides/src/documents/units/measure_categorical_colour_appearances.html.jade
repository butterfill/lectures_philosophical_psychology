  It is perhaps tempting to assume that claims about phenomenology
  cannot be tested scientifically.
  But this is a mistake.  We can use experiments to address the question, 
  Do things which have the property denoted by ‘red’ thereby appear to be different from things which lack it?

    An immediate problem arises from the fact that pairs of things  just one of which is \emph{red} (i.e. has the property denoted by ‘red’) differ not only in this way but also in which particular shade of colour they have.
    How can we tell whether differences in visual appearance are due in part to differences in being \emph{red} rather than entirely due to differences in shade?

    The problem can be overcome by introducing a third thing.  Consider constructing a sequence of three things which are indiscriminable except by colour.  Let the middle thing be \emph{red}, and let the first thing not be \emph{red}.  Now consider the difference between the particular hues of these two things.  Ensure the difference is small, but large enough that any two things which differ in hue by this amount are readily discriminable.  
    Finally, let the third thing be \emph{red}, and let the difference with respect to hue between the third and second thing be the same as the difference between the first and second thing.  (Research on colour perception shows that such differences can be equated, and that sequences of this type exist; see 
    \citealp{kuehni:2001_color} on perceptual uniformity and \citealp{witzel:2013_categorical} on categories.)  
    Consider the visual appearances of these three things.

    If, as the subject-determining platitude implies, humans visually experience properties like \emph{red}, then (given the premise) the first and second thing should differ in visual appearance more than the second and third thing.

      How can we test whether such differences in visual appearance  exist?  
      Several methods have recently been used \citep{witzel2014category,webster:2012_color,davidoff:2012_perceptual}. %(*cite thesis?).

      In one people are asked to judge, for each sequence, which of the two outer things (i.e. the first and third thing) is more similar to the middle thing (i.e. the second thing).  
      Given that visual appearances typically influence judgements of similarity,
      if things which differ in whether they are \emph{red} thereby differ in visual appearance, we would expect people to judge that the outer thing which is 
      \emph{red} is more similar to the middle thing than the other outer thing.

      ‘discrimination distance’:
      ‘The scale of psychological distance between colors we take as the "real" scale for present pur- poses is called discrimination distance. The unit of this scale is the just noticeable dif- ference (jnd), that is, the smallest physical difference in wavelength that can be detected by the human eye.’ \citep[p.~68]{kay_what_1984}
    .notes: :t
      \citep{kay_what_1984}: they did find an effect.
      ‘the English speaker judges chip B to be more similar to A than to C because the blue-green boundary passes between B and C, even though B is perceptually closer to C than to A.’ (p. 77)
      However they attribute this to the ‘naming strategy’ (given a difficult decision, fall back
      on differences in what is named).  
      ‘According to the name strategy hypothesis, the speaker who is confronted with a difficult task of classificatory judgment may use the lexical classification of the judged objects as if it were correlated with the required dimension of judgment even when it is not, so long as the structure of the task does not block this possibility’ (p. 75).
      They consider a modification to block use of the naming strategy,
      namely by showing subjects only two of the three stimuli at any one time (Experiment 2).
      (‘The three chips were arranged in a container with a sliding top that permitted the subject to see alternately either of two pairs of the three chips, but never all three at once. For example, in triad (A, B, C) the pairs alternately made visible were (A, B) and (B, C).’)
      When they do this, categorical colour properties have no effects on perceptual judgements of 
      similarlity.
      ‘Subjective similarity judgments follow discrimination distance and reflect no influence from lexical category boundaries’ (p. 73).
    .notes: :t
      According to more recent research discussed in \citep{witzel2014category}
      (a published report is not yet available)
      In fact they do not.
      That is, whether things are \emph{red} appears to make no difference to judgements of similarity (\citealp{witzel2014category}; actually these researchers did not test ‘red’, but they did test the German terms ‘Rosa’, ‘Braun’, ‘Orange’, ‘Gelb’, ‘Gruen’, ‘Blau’, and ‘Lila’.)
      This indicates that things which are \emph{red} do not thereby differ in visual appearance from things that are not \emph{red}.
    .notes: :t
      From correspondence:
      ‘that experiment was originally reported in the same paper as the "Categorical facilitation" one, but it was too long. Up to now it is only in my thesis and there is the abstract, which I paste you below. Note, however, that we found slight traces of perceptual magnet effects around prototypes when reanalysing the data later on, which is reflected in the book chapter, but not the older abstract. The found effects are quite systematic (happening at almost all prototypes), but also extremely weak, and there were literally no effects at boundaries.’
    .notes: :t
      How can we defend the view that red things differ in visual appearance from non-red things?
      Maybe there are differences in visual appearance that we are not aware of?
      Maybe the judgements of similarlity are not sensitive enough?
      (But note that \citet{witzel2014category} did find evidence for the effect of prototypes on
      judgements of similarity, so the method seems good: to test this, the three colour samples
      were arranged so that the prototype was positioned between a middle and an outer sample.
      ‘Colours close to the prototypes were judged to be more similar than they actually were in terms of pure discrimination’.)

      Another method involves asking people to adjust the colour of the middle object so that it appears to be mid-way between the two outer objects.
      What people  are in fact adjusting here is the hue of the object, but no mention is made of hue: their instructions are to match differences in appearance.
      If things which differ in whether they are \emph{red} thereby differ in visual appearance, we would expect people to compensate for this in adjusting hue.
      In fact they do not \citep{witzel2014category}.
      %
      %*NB: second approach (and third approach = perceptual grouping) matters because you might say that the things do appear differently, just in a way that we are unaware of.  Unawareness of the difference less plausibly affects grouping and hue matching; after all, if it doesn't affect these what does the difference in appearance affect?
    .notes: :t
      How can we defend the view that red things differ in visual appearance from non-red things?
      You could insist that the difference in appearance is not manifest in this particular case.
      Perhaps, for example, because the slider people used to ajust the middle sample changed 
      its hue, subjects attended to hue and ignored other features of the colour.
      (There’s no evidence for this speculation and subjects were not asked about the hue.)
    .notes: :t
      Are there other objections?
    .notes: :t
      Could you object that the difference in appearance between red and non-red things
      is already built into the metric used for the colour space?  In that case you would not
      expect additional effects of categorical colour property on appearance. These effects would be
      already taken into account in the measurements of similarity.
    .notes: :t
      To answer this objection we need to note that there are multiple ways of 
      measuring perceptual similarity.
      In this case, the researchers used JNDs.
      They have previously shown that category boundaries (as specified by an individual 
      subject’s colour words) do not affect JNDs.  That is, JNDs are not generally smaller at the
      category boundaries \citep{witzel:2013_categorical}.
      But when you take pairs of colours that are, say, 3 JNDs apart, then whether or not 
      the pair straddles a category boundary will affect speed and accuracy of discimination
      \citep{witzel:2014_categorical}.
      So we can be confident that using JNDs to measure perceptual similarity does not
      take into account differences in the ways categorical colour propreties appear.

    Converging evidence that things labelled with different basic colour terms do not 
    thereby differ in visual appearance involves a third method for detecting visual 
    appearances (\citealp{webster:2012_color}).  The idea, as illustrated in Figure \vref{fig:perceptual_grouping}, is that how things appear with respect to colour should influence how likely it is that they will be grouped together perceptually.  The results are consistent with the view that whether objects are labelled with the same basic colour term makes no measurable difference to how they are grouped perceptually.  This further supports suspicion that properties denoted by colour terms like ‘red’ make no difference to  visual appearances (see also \citealp{davidoff:2012_perceptual}).
  .notes: :t
    The point of all of these experiments is to see whether differences with 
    respect to the properties denoted by colour terms such as ‘red’ affect visual
    appearances. In each case the method requires that all other differences are
    matched. In theory, this makes it crucial that differences in hue and other
    aspects of colour can be appropriately measured. In practice optimally
    measuring such differences remains a significant challenge. However, when
    \citet{webster:2012_color} analysed their experiments using two different
    colour spaces (first a cone opponent space and then CIELAB), they got similar
    results in both cases.

      While doubts might be raised about the details of one or another method, the
      overall pattern is clear: the most careful attempts to find differences in
      appearance associated with properties denoted by colour terms like ‘red’ have
      all failed. 
    .notes: :t
      To reject this conclusion, we would have to insist that differences in
      appearance exist but influence neither judgements of perceptual similarity nor
      perceptual grouping and so are too subtle to detect. 
      This is certainly possible, but it seems wrong simply to insist that it is correct.

      Whether colour terms like ‘red’ denote properties of objects that are
      presented in visual experience is something best decided experimentally, not
      introspectively; and, as far as we know, they do not.
