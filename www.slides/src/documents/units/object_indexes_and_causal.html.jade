    The question was how we can get beyond intuition in understanding the verbal reports.
  p How to get beyond intuition?
  p The launching effect: detecting a 50ms difference in the delay between two movements.
  .notes: :t
    Part of the answer is this.  We don't worry about the content of the verbal reports.
    We just focus on the fact that their content changes depending on a tiny, 50 millisecond
    difference in the delay between two movements.
    Call this \emph{launching effect}.
  .notes: :t
    This doesn't tell us what people are detecting.
    But it does tell us that the effect is not merely confabulation or making it up.
    So we have taken a tiny step beyond intuition.  But we also have to answer two questions.

    .notes: :t
      But before we get to that, what is this about causal interactions?
      It's reasonably obvious that object indexes require segmentation (otherwise how would they
      attach to *objects*), and the evidence that they can survive occlusion is relatively easy to
      understand.  But the point that having object indexes involves tracking causal interactions
      is less straightforward.  So let's consider that ...
  
+slide({bkg:'slide_causal_london_52.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    Object indexes are linked to causation.
    In order to track objects, a perceptual system has to be sensitive to be causal interactions
  .notes: :t
    Why is this true?
    Because when you have a causal interaction, there's a conflict between principles of object 
    perception e.g. distinct surfaces=>two objects, vs good continuity of motion=>one object
    The perceptual system needs to know when conflicts should be reconciled and when they should 
    be written off.
    We get perceptual effects of causal interactions when there are conflicts among cues of object 
    identity.
  .notes: :t
    This is a point Michotte made.  He found that launching occurs when there is a conflict between 
    cues to object identity: good continuity of movement suggests a single object whereas the 
    existence of two distinct surfaces indicates two objects.
  .notes: :t
    It is plausible that other types of causal interaction also involve conflicts between cues 
    to object identity.

  .notes: :t
    Krushke and Fragassi (1996) have shown that the object-specific preview effect vanishes 
    in launching but not in various spatio-temporally similar sequences.  Since the object-specific 
    preview effect is regarded as diagnostic of feature binding, this is evidence that in launching 
    sequences, features of the second object (such as motion) remain bound to the first object for 
    a short time after the second object starts to move.

    Guess how the launching effect works! A natural thought is this: first you
    perceive objects, then you identify causal interactions based on contiguity
    etc. This turns out to be completely wrong.

+slide
  .notes: :t
    The impression of launching is judgement-independent.
    So it can't be a consequence of thinking about the interaction.
    Still, it might be a consequence of perceiving objects in certain relations to each other.
    However a key finding shows that this is wrong.
    Surprisingly, we don't first perceive objects and then get the launching effect;
    rather, the launching effect is tied up with perceptual process of identifying objects' surfaces.

            Causal capture is described by \citep{Scholl:2002eb}.
            As I said,
            normally, if the two balls overlap completely, subjects report seeing a single object 
            changing colour.
            But if we show subjects a sequence like the launching effect but where the first square 
            overlaps the second's position before it moves.  When this event is shown is isolation 
            almost all subjects see it as a single object changing colour.  But when the event is 
            shown with an 
            unambiguous launching effect nearby, almost all subjects now see the 'overlap' event as 
            a launching.
            Causal capture means that we can show subjects a sequence with complete overlap and 
            still have the report a causal effect.
            
          .notes: :t
            Why do we care about causal capture?  Because it gives rise to illusory causal

      ‘when there is a launching event beneath the overlap (or underlap event) timed such that 
      the launch occurs at the point of maximum overlap, observers inaccurately report that 
      the overlap is incomplete, suggesting that they see an illusory crescent.’ 
      \citep[p.\ 461]{Scholl:2004dx}
    .notes.handout: :t
      Why does the illusory causal crescent appear?  Scholl and Nakayama suggest a  
      ‘a simple categorical explanation for the Causal Crescents illusion: the visual system, 
      when led by other means to perceive an event as a causal collision, effectively 
      ‘refuses’ to see the two objects as fully overlapped, because of an internalized 
      constraint to the effect that such a spatial arrangement is not physically possible. 
      As a result, a thin crescent of one object remains uncovered by the other one-as 
      would in fact be the case in a straight-on billiard-ball collision where the motion 
      occurs at an angle close to the line of sight.’

      or its market value.’

    This is an important question insofar as we are concerned with detecting causal interactions.
    Is what people detect when the launching effect occurs a causal interaction?
    You might say, it can't be a causal interaction 
    because no delay between two movements is consistent with a causal interaction.

      Michotte said this:
    p.em-above.notes.show: :t
      ‘anyone not very familiar with the procedure involved in framing the physical concepts of 
      inertia, energy, conservation of energy, etc., might think that these concepts are simply 
      derived from the data of immediate experience.’
    span.notes.ctd \citep[p.\ 223]{Michotte:1946nz}
    p.right Michotte (1946, p. 223)
    .notes: :t
      How is this consistent with the laws of mechanics—surely no pause can be tolerated? 
      Ingeniously, Michotte compares launching with the movement of a single object. The single 
      object moves half way across a screen then pauses before continuing to move. Michotte found 
      that the longest pause between the two movements consistent with subjects experiencing them 
      as a single movement is around 80ms, exactly the longest pause consistent with experiences 
      characteristic of launching \citep[pp.\ 91--8, 124]{Michotte:1946nz}. Accordingly, the 
      experience characteristic of launching appears to require that the two movements be 
      experienced as uninterrupted—--this is why they can be separated by a pause of up to but 
      no longer than 80ms.

  .notes The question for this section was:
  p.notes.ctd.show Can humans perceive causal interactions?
  .notes: :t
    Now I think we have achieved an answer:
  p.em-above.notes.show: :t
    Perceptual systems identify certain kinds of causal interaction in the course of 
    tracking objects.
  .notes: :t
    The perceptual system responsible for identifying objects must also concern itself with certain 
    kinds of causal interaction in order to reconcile conflicting cues to object identity. 
  .notes: :t
    In slightly more detail: one function of our perceptual systems is to identify and track 
    objects; this is done by means of various cues; sometimes the visual system is faced with 
    conflicting cues to object identity which need to be resolved in order to arrive at a 
    satisfactory interpretation; when certain types of causal interaction occur there is a 
    conflict among cues to object identity; these conflicts must be treated differently from other 
    conflicts because they do not indicate failures of object identification and so do not  
    require resolution or further perceptual processing. 
    So object perception depends on sensitivity to certain types of causal interaction and this is 
    why the launching effect occurs.

    Causal interactions are detected by the perceptual processes involved in segmenting
    and tracking objects.
  .notes: :t
    This is unexpected insofar as perception is often supposed to be limited to features of the 
    world less abstract that causal interactions.  Indeed, the notion that perceptual processes
    represent three-dimensional objects rather than mere surfaces was at one time controversial.
    The research we have reviewed shows that perceptual processes represent not only 
    three-dimensional but properly physical objects, that is, objects capable of causally
    interacting with each other.
  .notes: :t
    As we'll see in a moment, this is relevant to understanding the Problem we encountered 
    in the lecture on objects.
