      [Key idea: object indexes cannot explain too much otherwise 
      it would be a mystery why 2 years olds fail to search.
      But then how do you get looking times out of them?]
    .notes: :t
      In adult humans,
      there is a system of object indexes which enables them to track 
      potentially moving objects in ongoing actions such as visually tracking or 
      reaching for objects, and which influences how their attention is allocated 
      \citep{flombaum:2008_attentional}.

      .notes: :t
        This system of object indexes
        does not involve belief or knowledge
        and may assign indexes to objects in ways that are inconsistent with
        a subject’s beliefs about the identities of objects 
        \citep[e.g.][]{Mitroff:2004pc, mitroff:2007_space}

  .notes: :t
    The primary functions of object indexes include influencing the allocation
    of attention and perhaps guiding ongoing action.
    If this is right, it may be possible to explain anticipatory looking 
    directly by appeal to the operations of  object indexes.
    But the operations of object indexes cannot directly explain differences 
    in how novel things are to an infant.
    And nor can the operations of object indexes directly explain why infants
    look longer at stimuli involving discrepancies in the physical behaviour
    of objects.
  .notes: :t
    To illustrate this point, recall this famous habituation experiment ....
  .notes: :t
    We know that infants are likely to maintain object indexes for the object
    while it is occluded.
    Accordingly, when the screen drops in the condition labelled 
    ‘impossible outcome’, there is an interruption to the normal 
    operation of object indexes: infants have assigned two object indexes 
    but there is only one object.
    But why does this cause infants to look longer at in the
    ‘impossible outcome’ condition than in the ‘possible outcome’ condition?
    How does a difference in operations involving object indexes result
    in a difference in looking times?
  .notes: :t
    Claim (supported by the developmental discrepancy): the phenomenology
    associated with the launching effect is rich enough to support habituation
    effects but not manual search.
    Consequence: the experience is probably not an experience of causal interaction.

    I think we have to reject the phenomenal parts of Michotte’s view:
  .notes.show
    p: :t
      Sometimes ‘a causal impression arises, clear,
      genuine, and unmistakable, and the idea of cause can be derived from it
      … in just the same way as the idea of shape or movement can be derived
      from the perception of shape or movement.’

    ‘the causal perception is the perception of the work of a mechanical force,
    just as the impression of the movement of a car is the perception of its
    displacement in physical space’
