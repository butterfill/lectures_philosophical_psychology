title: "A Question about Experiences of (Speech) Actions"
tags: []
description: """
  What do we experience when we encounter others’ actions?
  One hypothesis (the Indirect Hypothesis) says that such experiences are all experiences of bodily
  configurations, of joint displacements and of effects characteristic of particular actions.
  Another hypothesis (the Direct Hypothesis) says that 
  in observing an action we sometimes experience not only bodily configurations and joint displacements
  and their sensory effects but also the action as directed to a particular outcome.

        I suppose that speech actions are actions, so I will start with those.
