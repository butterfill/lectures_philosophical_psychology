    \textbf{Since any broadly inferential process must make a trade-off between
    speed and accuracy, having two or more systems each capable of 
    predicting objects’ trajectories could be advantageous.}

    Since this is an important point for me, let me repeat:
    any broadly inferrential process must make a trade-off between
    speed and accuracy.

  .notes speed vs accuracy:
  .notes: :t
    Here you see the results of an old experiment by Henmon
    who had subjects judge which of two only very slightly different 
    lines was longer.
    He noted that ‘under each category of judgment the wrong judgments 
    are in general shorter’.
  .notes: :t
    This experiment doesn’t provide evidence for a speed-accuracy
    trade off and wasn’t designed to (speed was not experimentally mainpulated).
    But it’s interesting that the idea of a speed-accuracy trade-off 
    goes back such a long way.
  .notes: :t
    Henmon p. 195: ‘A continuation of this investigation (1) where the time of 
    exposure of stimuli was limited, (2) where the time of judgment was voluntarily 
    shortened or prolonged, (3) and with
    varying differences in stimuli, should give significant results.
    footnote: The writer had planned such an investigation, but a change of work 
    has necessitated its indefinite postponement; hence the publication of these 
    preliminary results.’
  .notes: :t
    \textbf{The value of having two systems which process inputs from a single
    domain arises from this trade-off.}  Having multiple systems enables 
    complementary trade-offs to be made.
    So it is not obvious that there could not be 
    two systems both of which can predict the trajectories of moving objects.

  .handout An agent’s \emph{field} is a set of objects related to the agent by proximity, orientation and other factors.
  .handout First approximation: an agent \emph{encounters} an object just if it is in her field.
  .handout A \emph{goal} is an outcome to which one or more actions are, or might be, directed.  
  .handout %(Not to be confused with a \emph{goal-state}, which is an intention or other state of an agent linking an action to a particular goal to which it is directed.)
  .handout \textbf{Principle 1}: one can’t goal-directedly act on an object unless one has encountered it.
  .handout Applications: subordinate chimps retrieve food when a dominant is not informed of its 
    | location \citep{Hare:2001ph}; when observed scrub-jays prefer to cache in shady, distant and 
    | occluded locations \citep{Dally:2004xf,Clayton:2007fh}.
  .handout First approximation: an agent \emph{registers} an object at a location just if she most recently encountered the object at that location.
  .handout A registration is \emph{correct} just if the object is at the location it is registered at.
  .handout \textbf{Principle 2}: correct registration is a condition of successful action.
  .handout Applications: 12-month-olds point to inform depending on their informants’ goals and ignorance \citep{Liszkowski:2008al}; 
    | chimps retrieve food when a dominant is misinformed about its location \citep{Hare:2001ph}; 
    | scrub-jays observed caching food by a competitor later re-cache in private \citep{Clayton:2007fh,Emery:2007ze}.
  .handout \textbf{Principle 3}: when an agent performs a goal-directed action and the goal specifies an object, the agent will act as if the object were actually in the location she registers it at.
  .handout Applications: some false belief tasks \citep{Onishi:2005hm,Southgate:2007js,Buttelmann:2009gy}.
